1. Disable all ModAPI plugins.
2. Uninstall ModAPI.
3. Optional - Back up your save folder. This can be found in (Users>Username>AppData>locallow>SKS) and the folder within that directory can be copied elsewhere on your hard drive for safe keeping.

The bug I am referring to is the inability to save games on multiplayer games.  Apparently this is a common bug as research on google shows.  However, it does not affect everyone's game\/computer.  For an example, I am able to host a game and have a friend join.  The second I try to save the screen goes black and doesn't return.  My friend can save and continue playing the game with no problems. The weird part is, is that he says my character can still move by my controls.  Therefore, my game is not crashing...it is just not showing a display.  Aka the black screen of death.

I can save in single player with no problems, it's just multiplayer.  I've tried windowed\/fullscreen, alt+tabbing in and out, running the game in compatibility, and reinstalling on different drives.  However, when my friend hosts the game and I join he can save, but I still have the same issue. At one point it was NOT like this, I could save with no issues (multi and single player).

Hey guys, just recently been playing The Forest with my friend Rob and we got to the end of the Sahara Research Lab.

*SPOILER* Here you encounter the young girl Megan, who then proceeds to turn into a mutant. While one person experiences the cutscene the other is dragged into one place to watch it happen. Now once she finished becoming a mutant that's when we should've began battle, however we were both frozen into place, he could only open his map and I could only hit and open my map - so, generally very useless. However we took no damage, became fully hungry and thirsty and continued to take no damage.

As you can't save anywhere in the lab, we are now having to give it another go all the way from the beginning. Fingers crossed it doesn't happen again, and be careful to anyone else giving this boss a go in multiplayer.

Tried all types of things from rebooting to shutting down any possible
program that might cause an issue. And you can't navigate with

So I tried running on my gaming laptop instead. That works fine,
however, the server does not come up in dedicated server list. A few
dozen others do, but not mine. (It works fine for my team).

My guess on that is that because the server is tied to my account
(this is a dedicated server through a hosting company, nitrado) , and
I am running my steam account on a separate computer (which is mine
and works fine with other games) maybe that is the issue.

Regardless, is there anything that can be done or am I out of luck?


I'll skip sending the hardware etc. as this is happening server side. Meaning, the list of servers is populated with all dedicated servers, just not mine, so would not be a harware issue, etc. on my end.

Hi everyone, 

I found this ""weener connection"" at the yacht (with all those dead sharks; or did it find me?!). It attacked me while inside (!) the boat thru (!) the sides of the boat. I fled to the land after getting most of the boat ... BUT: it follows! It sounds like a huge dragon with wings, but it looks like a weener connection. :)

It is able to deconstruct (killed it between rocks at another beach, after losing everything) ... so single pieces attack. But if it's connected\/constructed it's crazy strong - destroyed my place to be in the game (further screenshot in profile) within less a minute.

Everything I could do was run and keep in motion ... hide ... and kill it between the rocks as mentioned (used them for a bit cover). But the save game is lost ... I won't build up everything again.

Well, maybe missing texture or even a missing all-of-it - or bug because it's a creature with glitch and wallhack. :D (knows all the time, where I am) It was hard to fight if you have no clue where it starts or ends.

The Forest,Horror,Sanders,0,Useful advices in case of performance issues,en,-,"This Article is mainly for Intel & NVIDIA users : 

Due to recent performance issues regarding The Forest on one of my PCs, here's some trusworthy tips that will surely help you if you are also experiencing performance-like troubles

A-Ensure your computer is up to date 
  A.a- If your CPU is Intel, consider using ""Intel® Driver & Support Assistant"" downloadable on Intel website --> extremely useful for driver checks -> AVOID other non-official drivers checker

B - Perform a clean GPU driver reinstall doing the following steps : 
1. Download the NVIDIA Cleanup Tool (CleanupTool.exe) from the download link below:
https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/cleanup-tool
2. Double-click the executable to launch the tool.
3. Click ACCEPT to accept the End User License Agreement.
4. Click Yes at the confirmation prompt.
The progress dialog appears.
Click OK at the completion dialog to close the dialog.

All NVIDIA software and drivers (including CUDA) have now been removed from the system.
NVIDIA recommends rebooting the system after the tool is finished

5. Select & download the driver corresponding to your GPU and OS here : https:\/\/www.nvidia.com\/download\/index.aspx
6.- Run the downloaded driver
- Select ""Driver with GeForce Experience"".
- SELECT ""Custom (Advanced)"" install option and click Next.
- Put a CHECKMARK in the ""Perform clean install"" option and click Next.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Once it is installed, RESTARTthe computer

C. If this is not helping, perform a clean uninstall of the game from Steam
  NOTE: Steam will keep your game saves , you do NOT need to manually delete %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\SKS\TheForest\ as it shouldn't affect your game performance

D. If not helping, consider uninstalling any software that affects your GPU (GPU Tweak III for instance or anything similar)

E.  For Windows 11 users, consider (for testing purpose) disabling the following  : Windows settings > System > Display > Graphics > Change default Graphic settings > ""Variable framerate""

At this point, you are basically playing using vanilla settings so you should notice improvements
Obviously your CPU, RAM and GPU should NOT reach 100% of usage
If so , your game will run but you will inevitably experience a non-smooth gaming session
Same goes for temperature, keep an eye on these (CPU & GPU) --> ""Hardware Monitor"" is a good and light software allowing you to check that 
MOST components should NEVER reach beyong 90° (even 90° is already a lot)
Also MAKE SURE your PSU is delivering ENOUGH power for your whole computer setup --> for instance : a RTX 3070 requires at least a 600W PSU , otherwise your components might not get the required power and thus get performance-lowered.

F. (bonus) There's a eventually another solution for those NOT being able to reach the game quality\/FPS they SHOULD have
When the game starts it prompts you what screen resolution & graphic you wish to get
--> personnally , it bugged me out as when entering the game, it would try to re-apply my usual custom in-game graphic settings and thus conflict with what was selected in the first prompt window

 ---> to resolve it, it's quite simple : Close the game > Open ""Regedit"" from Windows Search bar and reach ""Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\""    > then DELETE ""SKS"" Folder     (this is where your personal settings and key bindings are , including the prompt menu)

If even after all that you are still facing troubles > just go make your computer checked by a local IT repair shop and explain in details what you have done and the results obtained

The Forest,Horror,Erbrechen,0,Gamepad not working correctly,en,-,"So, yesterday was my first time playing this game with a controller and it worked perfectly fine, I was very excited since the controller is new (Xbox one series x|s). 
However, a couple hours ago today when I tried to play again with the joystick I noticed I  couldn't sprint nor crouch, so I tried doing it with my keyboard and it worked. The rest of the buttons work normally, so apparently, [b] the problem is just when I press the thumbsticks [\/b] (buttons 10 and 11, if I'm not wrong), it seems like the game doesn't recognize them.

So far I've tried:
[list]
    [*] Changing the steam input to all options. 
    [*] Disconnecting and reconnecting the joystick. 
    [*] Uninstalling and reinstalling the game.
    [*] Changing the ""hold"" to ""toggle"" and back again in both options (crouch and sprint).
[\/list]

[b] I'm 100% sure it's not a problem with the controller itself [\/b] since I've tried a gamepad tester and all buttons\/triggers\/thumbsticks are recognized without any problem (including pressing the thumbsticks, of course). I've also tried other games and everything works perfectly fine.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

However, a couple hours ago today when I tried to play again with the joystick I noticed I  couldn't sprint nor crouch, so I tried doing it with my keyboard and it worked. The rest of the buttons work normally, so apparently, [b] the problem is just when I press the thumbsticks [\/b] (buttons 10 and 11, if I'm not wrong), it seems like the game doesn't recognize them.

So far I've tried:
[list]
    [*] Changing the steam input to all options. 
    [*] Disconnecting and reconnecting the joystick. 
    [*] Uninstalling and reinstalling the game.
    [*] Changing the ""hold"" to ""toggle"" and back again in both options (crouch and sprint).
[\/list]

[b] I'm 100% sure it's not a problem with the controller itself [\/b] since I've tried a gamepad tester and all buttons\/triggers\/thumbsticks are recognized without any problem (including pressing the thumbsticks, of course). I've also tried other games and everything works perfectly fine.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Phasmophobia,Horror,Lombaxtard,1,Controller Support in Menus (Settings AND In-Game menus both),en,-,"(I used DualShock 4 to play)
It's not great. Cursor is quite slow, controller prompts in the match settings lobby tend to not appear (d-pad at the sides). On a completely unrelated note, if you crouch while in settings (seemingly only when using a controller) quite often you may never uncrouch unless you change lobbies\/start a map. Using completely stock controls layout I'm able to use microphone with L1 (LB) and R1 (RB) WHILE in journal, which even has prompts for the same keys used to jump through categories (photos, evidence, ghosts, etc.). That means every time I peek into journal during a hunt and try go through evidence I have to only use a slow cursor, otherwise I risk getting my mic being picked up by the ghost for navigating menu the intended way. Default controls also assume you're using Cross (A) to turn on and off handheld electronics and interact with cursed possessions. There's an issue however, it's the same button that is used for confirming an option if you're using text instead of speech recognition (especially now that after recent couple of updates Vosk suddenly stopped recognizing my speech at all without any change in game settings and I'm now Forced to use text recognition), which means that if I activate a Spirit Box using Cross (A) I will instantly select an option for a question to the ghost. It's not a huge deal, but I literally cannot enter Ouija board without asking a question, no matter how fast I depress the button. Also, this means that if I remap dropping items to Circle (B) I will not be able to select whatever option is associated with that button in the menu - I will instantly drop the object.

So to summarize, there needs to be a clear separation between in-game and in-menus, so that controls don't get mixed up and I don't lose sanity by unintentionally asking something through Ouija board that I didn't care for, and not to bring ghosts to me while in hiding spots by going through journal using actual prompts from developers. This separation would automatically account for custom mappings",en,-,"Controller Support in Menus (Settings AND In-Game menus both)(I used DualShock 4 to play)

Phasmophobia,Horror,tuc,1,Weird behaviour when headgear is picked up simultaneously by two players,en,-,"I just played a game where me and my buddy both picked up the head gear simultaneously and it caused some very weird behaviour...

1) I was able to toggle his night vision goggles on and vica versa. (Imagine the griefing potential during the hunt ːsteammockingː)

2) After my friend had put his headgear back on van's rack, I was able to control the headgear hanging in the van with my toggle night vision key and it did activate the headgear hanging on the wall (sound effect and goggle movement animations). The nightvision goggles did not have any effect on me or my vision, but I was still able to control the gear which was hanging in the rack and was equipped my no one!

3) I was not able to pick up or equip the headgear which my friend had left on the equipment wall. I was still able to toggle it on and off, but I was not able to equip it.

4) I did not have the view model for the night vision goggles on my screen. I mean, normally there should be pair of goggles on top of the screen indicating that person had equipped the night vision goggles. I guess the game still thought that the goggles were equipped by another player.

I was not able to do more vigorous or systematic testing on how this bug behaves, but the take away is that it is possible to duplicate night vision goggles by taking the same item simultaneously and that way other players can either activate or deactivate other players night vision goggles, if the setup is right.

Phasmophobia,Horror,Brin_Fallgard,3,Text Bug,en,-,"Heyo, I only recently started playing, but I think I found an issue with the text system. 

I'm playing without a mic, so I wanted to try out the text system that lets you ask questions to the ghost to check for spirit box evidence. Well, I turned it on, and I couldn't turn it off again. I tried going around the map, asking questions, or just sitting in the truck. I could move, interact with objects, turn my flashlight on and off, and cycle through my inventory, but I couldn't open my journal, or the menu. The only way out of it was to trigger the keypad in the truck and leave. I could turn it off when I was back in the main lobby - though that meant I couldn't report the ghost type, or document any further evidence. 

It's only a minor issue, but if you're like me and don't have a mic, or otherwise can't use one, there's no functioning alternative. I know you don't technically need the spirit box at all, but it's helpful when you have a shy ghost, or can't work out exactly where the ghost room is. At the moment, I end the mission assuming that there is spirit box evidence if I've found nothing else after the first two pieces of evidence. However, sometimes it's simply a matter of missing things like orbs, dots, and fingerprints - if my camera isn't set up in exactly the right position, or there is little in a room for a ghost to interact with that could provide fingerprint evidence.

As I said, it's not a major bug, but since it's an accessibility feature, I definitely feel it's something that needs fixing.

Phasmophobia,Horror,Saintinel,1,Radio voice comes out locally,en,-,"Hello,

For a good while now, while playing phasmo, when trying to radio my teammates my voice will come out locally. Meaning that unless the person is right besides me, they won't hear me. All they will hear is the radio sound twice (once when I first press and and once when I release).  This does not always happen, I would say it happens maybe 30 to 40% of the time but it is quite a game breaking bug as it prevents me from communicating information to my teammates and in more than 1 instance it prevented me from giving them a key information which resulted in 1 or more of them dying trying to get that info again (not knowing I already had it).

I have seen a few post made about this issue and similar issues but most of them have no replies and seeing as they date from fairly far back, also seems like the devs are either not aware or are ignoring the issue. Does anyone have any permanent or temporary fix for this? I tried looking around but couldn't find any.

Here is what I tried so far:

- Verifying integrity of files (More than once)
- Uninstalling and reinstalling  (More than once)
- Using a different mic (Even tho it's clearly not a hardware issue since the sound does come out, just not on the radio)
- Changing Keybind
- Made sure all my drivers were up to date (Couldn't be that either but why not)

Sadly, I can't think of anything else I could try.

Thank you for your time and have a nice day!

There has been several other playthroughs where the same had happened and as well as with other ghost types. RN im only playing nightmare mode, but also when I used to play Professional Mode the game would glitch so hard I'd get ZERO Evidences - even on single player mode.

So I'm thinking about closing the book on this game until the next update comes out and then I finally might check on things again. 

Currently, It's impossible to play online without friends due to the number of hackers\/cheaters and grieffers running the game. I only get 1 good game without these type of players after trying out 7 online matches.

The number of players who don't understand the game is too big, the devs should definitively work on a bigger tutorial for new players, it should teach players how to get each of the ghost types as well as teach them what they should or shouldn't not do in order to catch a ghost.

and ofc, the game should reward players for going through every single ghost tutorial by giving them +1 prestige level. With this in the game, it should be harder for cheaters to pass by as new players and trick old players  and at the same time it takes a considerably ammount of effort to get +1 prestige for doing all the ghost tutorials - if this is ever implemented, of course; so this way no players will be risking throwing away an account that has gotten it's +1 prestigee for completing tutorial, because it's an ""uncomfortable"" punishment. as result, less players are going to cheat or grief.",en,-,"Game Inconsistence Bug/GlitchGhosts are still inconsistent AF, I got a ghost which I thought it was going to be a Raiju or a Yokai, the ghost passed the yokai test and failed the raiju test; HOWEVER, on the result screen I got 'Thay' instead and the ghost never did a single ghost event, wasn't active enough for a thay and never did a single thay thing even tho I spent zero time on the ghost room it also had Normal Running Speeds.

That dll is required for VR to work hence why rename it instead of delete, you may have to do this each time after update because the dll will be redownloaded if the devs did any change to it",-,https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/4035851135395009626/,03/12/23 08:27,18/01/2024 10:10:30,Bug Report,2

Phasmophobia,Horror,toxicgloom,1,Hunt Loop/Endless Hunt Bug?,en,-,"Hey! So, me and my friends have run into the issue one time, guaranteed, and I suspect one of our first hunts was the same bug because it went on for several minutes before I died (only one in the house.)

A hunt was triggered when my friend went into the house to grab a picture of a Monkey's Paw. He was just going to wait it out in a closet, but after about two minutes, we started commenting on how long it was. My friend never left the closet. I had died at this point, and was following the ghost around as it destroyed the house. 

It seemed like it never ended, but, we realized that, occasionally, our surviving friend that was outside, could open the door for a few moments before it slammed shut every time he tried to enter the house.

We finally decided that the friend in the closet would make a run for it, and he made it to the front door before the door slammed shut again, and he was killed. The hunt ended, then, and our surviving friend was able to drive off.

The ghost was a yokai, if that helps any.

The game statistics afterwards said that we had spent 48 minutes on this map, and gone through 23 ghost hunts, leaving me believing that every time a hunt ended, it would be triggered again right away, so it gave the illusion of a never-ending hunt.

I'm not sure, but it was a real bummer on our game night and we stopped playing right after because it was just so annoying.",en,-,"Hunt Loop/Endless Hunt Bug?Hey!
