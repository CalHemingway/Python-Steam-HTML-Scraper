Another Problem!,QutisBrutus,0,"So it said in the Patch 4 update \""Keep Your Scissors: the policeman will no longer steal your scissors\"" but after that update my scissors kept resetting to the treehouse after Keith (the policeman) got me. But the update did say the Keith stole your scissors so maybe that meant that some people couldn't get the scissors back. I didn't run into my scissors ever being stolen by Keith though.

Tried to change this in the settings (For this I still needed to use my mouse as any buttons still don't work for getting into a submenu) I have it now on 0% sensitivity but it still has the same speed and feels unplayable to me.\n\nEDIT: Had to put sensitivity on 0%\/20%\/20% aka all on the lowest possible to make it work. Leaves me with not being able to go through the menu on a controller as no button seems to work as the \""confirm\"" button.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1321680/discussions/1/3710432845031253834/,,,,,,,,Hello Neighbour 2

Steak on Day 4 is Bugged,R0ck0 R4m4,2,"On Day 4 you explore the big white house where you put the awards on the podium to get the ship wheel. One of the puzzles involves you putting out a fire in a grill to grab a steak. After you grab the steak you feed it to the dog. \n\nI am unable to pick up the steak even though visually it looks like the fire was put out. I've tried reloading my last save, closing the game entirely, rebooting, etc... The steak is bugged and I am unable to pick it up.\n\nI am unable to progress the game further because I cannot finish the piece of this puzzle. Any help would be appreciated!",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1321680/discussions/1/3710432845026710005/,,,,,,,,Hello Neighbour 2

No Sound,nancie634,0,"I can;t get any sound to work on Hello Neighbor 2.  I have several other games that the sound is working for, but 2 of my steam games have no sound.

I don't understand why some games the sound works and a few it doesn't.  it doesn't make sense.
