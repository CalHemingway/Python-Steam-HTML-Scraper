If you are ever tempted to 'Validate' Warframe for troubleshooting purposes, please do it through the Warframe Launcher and [b]not Steam[\/b]. The Warframe Launcher Validation will be significantly less bandwidth intensive. The Steam Validation results in deleting and redownloaing the entire game. Using Steam Validation should only be done in extreme cases where the Warframe Launcher won't even open. 

Thank you.

I've been playing this game on Linux for a long time. For some time, I have played it without Steam (directly via its launcher through Lutris), and it seems I have some achivements that are locked, even though I have unlocked them in game. I have been playing on Steam after I stopped playing via Lutris, and I have unlocked some more achievements as a result.

For instance, I have the ""True Master"" achievement unlocked, but I don't have other achievements, like ""Dragon"" (maybe Dragon something), which doesn't really make sense, considering these are just a reflection of your mastery rank. Since I'm Legendary Rank 3 (MR33), and Dragon is unlocked when you hit Mastery Rank 22, it doesn't really make sense to not have Dragon unlocked but to have the True Master rank unlocked, considering this is just a direct progression (1-to-1).

Same goes for other achievements. I have them unlocked in game, but this isn't reflected on Steam.

Can someone help me out with this?

So I downloaded Warframe today and went through the tutorial without issue. As soon as I reached my ship I noticed stuttering. I restarted my game and it fixed the issue. I then loaded into the next mission and the stuttering came back. The stuttering seems to be associated with loading into a second instance of sorts. There is also a flash of light blue near the bottom of my monitor occasionally.

Temperatures are fine with my 7800x3d not even pushing spikes of 65. 4070ti is also very comfortable at 60. The issue persists even when in the options menu. The game is fine until I load into that second instance it seems. Where for my first time playing it was fine in the tutorial zone, and stuttering in the ship. Upon restarting fine in the ship, stuttering when in the first earth mission.

I thought a video of the problem might be helpful.
https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ldg6rRr4mEU

Things I have tried
1.Changing the game settings\/going to dx12\/V ysnc etc
2.Changing NVIDIA control panel settings including, max frame rate, v sync, and power management
3. Disabling every startup program except Microsoft in msconfig.
3a. Manually ending everything else in task manger except what seemed like core files.
4. Changing a security security setting (ASLR)
5.Updating Drivers
5a. Rolling back Drivers
5b.Clearing Driver Cache
5c.DDUing Drivers
6.Reinstalling the game
7. Turning off all overclock on my GPU
8.Changing BIOS settings including XMP, and resize bar

Temps are fine. No issues in any other games. Specific to Warframe. I did notice that where my GPU usually has a bit of coil whine normally, when the stutters\/freezes hit the coil whine stops. I hope that helps, I have been trying to solve it for 3 days and I am pretty much done with trying anything I can think of.

Any help would be appreciated!","en","-","I have really bad in-game stutteringHello.

"Warframe","Shooter","AnnetteW","0","Ability in use - Bug (created also ticket on WF site)","en","-","Hello,
while playing Warframe i found a bug called ""ability in use."" Due to this bug, I can't attack in the game. Fall to void and \/unstuck does not repair this and I cannot also swap to Operator, because it's ""ability"" too. I got this during:
Cast first ability on Mirage (school Zenurik) = this ability is ""one cast"" and due to ""ability in use"" I'm instantly bugged, because You cannot ""recast"" this ability until duration is 0, but ability in use is basically ""duration infinite"" even when You fail to use this ability. So die is the only way.

Same bug I also got on Gara with 4th ability (channeling), but when I got enough energy I could recast 4th ability, that removed this bug. But it was with school Unairu.

This led me to believe that this bug can be caused by both the ""one cast"" and ""channeling"" abilities. But when I look at the fact that the ""one cast"" ability does not take energy immediately, but within 1s,... it works the same way as channeling.

I'm not sure what exactly it is, but I got the same bug during Index with Excalibur Umbra. So it's probably cause when You use abilities on low energy, when this energy is taken away by game mechanics and the remaining energy does not cover the ""ability cost"" for your ability. (Eximus stealing energy, -1 energy per s in Index, etc.)

Hope You repair this bug.","en","-","Ability in use - Bug (created also ticket on WF site)Hello,

First time I rolled back my laptop to an earlier point and resolved the frozen issue.

Second time I tried a few more approaches(because system update is important, CANNOT STAY IN PAST FOREVER RIGHT) including the following:

1) restore the graphic setting to default - did not work
2) uninstall the game and reinstall - did not work
3) delete the DX cache file under Nvidia folder - did not work
4) uninstall graphic driver and reinstall(used DDU to remove it clean) - did not work
5) run system diagnostic following the manufacturer's instructions - no issues found
6) uninstall graphic driver and install an older version - finally worked

The older graphic card driver worked for me is Nvidia 531.29. Maybe some versions work too but I was too tired to try it out one by one. 

At lease now I know the issue is the graphic driver update. I will stay on this version for now.

I encountered this two times few hours ago again in SP Survival with same Misery issue, thought first its my fault cause I did something wrong but this third time i saw and intentionally not shooting him to see what will happen.

Today I encounter these two riven challenges:
- Kill 2 Dargyn Pilots before they hit the ground while sliding.
- Kill 3 Dargyn Pilots before they hit the ground while aim gliding.

With Titania 1st skill to remove pilots from the aircraft, I have tried:
- [1st Challenge] Shoot them with Ocucor during\/ after statis (from Titania 1st skill) while they are falling down and I am sliding on the ground below.
- [1st Challenge] Use Titania 3rd skill to capture and detonate them while sliding.
- [1st Challenge] Use Titania 1st skill to pick up a target walking on the ground and slide kill them with Xoris detonation.
- [2nd Challenge] Aim glide killing the pilot during stasis with Ocucor\/ Ignis Wraith.
Each of the method I have attempted at least 3 times, and none were registered.

Notable:
- The challenge show up when I enter PoE does not match description on riven mod, they simply say: ""Kill 0\/X Dargyn Pilots before they hit the ground"" for both challenges.
- I finished 2 other challenges just fine:
 + Headshot 8 enemies from at least 75m away. (from memory, may not accurate)
 + Complete a defense mission of at least level 30 without letting defense target taking damage. (from memory, may not accurate)

Basic info:
- Challenge riven is equipped on Xoris\/ Stropha and active (hence why I see the riven challenge when enter PoE).
- Loadout: Titania + Ignis Wraith + Ocucor + melee weapon (Xoris\/ Stropha).
- I watched guide video of someone doing exact same challenge (2nd challenge) with Titania and copy move-by-move, even using same weapon (Ignis Wraith).

After hours of looking around for target, try different methods (kill them outright, find them on ground and try different skills, shuriken instead of guns), I came to conclusion this specific type of challenge may be bugged and may need investigate, hence this post for notice.
It is a tough one to gather more info because I have to search for target and each target I only have one chance at it.
Thank you.","en","-","[Potentially Bug] Riven challenge not register: ""Kill X Dargyn Pilots before they hit the ground while Y""Hello,

Since some prior update my keybinds in game for my DS4 have stopped working.

I'm aware that this has been an issue for a while and has something to do with steam, the controller itself works but has unchangeable default binds that just suck for me.

I tried manually changing the controller binds in steam for warframe but it seems some options just don't exist to change another button to or I'm missing them somewhere.

Does anyone know a method to get this working? I previously used CIRCLE to slide\/crouch, R1 for melee, SQUARE for reload and L1 for the ability wheel. 

Thanks for anyone with any insight or anyone able to help!



Edit: Turns out since the last update disabling steam input through your library entirely fixes the problem and allows your DS4 to work in game as it did previously! Just make sure you have it enabled in warframe's settings, disable steam input for warframe specifically, restart steam and you're good to go!","en","-","Need Help With Controller Binds (Solved!)Hey, I play with controller since with my setup it is just more comfortable in every way.

Normally, that's not an issue. For the past two years I've been using college wi-fi and it's never as good as home wi-fi, but it never affected my game performance and only disconnected me back to the log in screen when the routers just went bad. That's how it was for the past year.

That wasn't the case this time. Instead, I was stuck in the mission for 10 minutes without being sent back to the log-in screen, unable to do anything. I resorted to manually closing the game via Task Manager, but when I logged back in, the problems started: FPS stutter, freeze-frames when I move around or move my cursor, crashing whenever I'm starting a mission public or solo, or going into open world islands like Fortuna and Deimos. Long loading times when I'm leaving those missions as completions (It took my computer 4 minutes to load from Fortuna to Orb Vallis and another 10 whole minutes to load from Orb Vallis BACK into Fortuna afterwards. 5 minutes of loading back into my orbiter from those same places as well with FPS and quality dipping significantly.

I tried everything, updating drivers, Verifying and Optimizing Caches, Re-Installing the game FIVE TIMES, yet these problems still persist. I don't think hardware is the issue, because before these issues occurred I was having instant loading times and smooth FPS above 60.

Railjack Bugs:
-Going to a dojo from another player with the railjack
-Looking at a look while travelling on railjack (before travelling)
-Stuck on loading screens while going to missions
-ETC...

Crew problems:
-Not going straight for the radiators
-Getting higher priorities on other ships rather than ramsleds or any important thing for the mission
-Horrible pilots
-Engineers end up dying
-Cant do good defense to the railjack as they all end up dead
-Unbalanced damage (low)

Enemy problems:
-Hitting the air
-Rarely doing any damage from the inside which was the reason why they were brought there, lol
-Sometimes ignores crew and other times goes into a 7v1 with the engineer
-Ramsleds hitbox... just horrible and highly unbalanced

Railjack weapons problems (least problematic ones for now):
-Middle click shots will sometimes miss (i mean in the sense that it should track the enemy but it just misses

Railjack mission problems:
-Orphix are almost impossible to do, and yes, i tried using 4, using middle click but the rate just goes up so fast that they are almost impossible to do alone, and no one plays them so you cant do it on public too
-Lack of original missions, the railjack missions are new, i know, but half of them are just ripoff of other missions such as defense and survival with some new railjack things, like there arent much railjack original missions, only orphix, skirmish and volatile, the rest are just like the others

Railjack suggestions:
-Making reactor able to produce energy for the railjack that can only be used for railjack abilities so the frame doesnt has to use his own energy
-Updating crew so they are smarter and go for priorities first such as ramsleds or objetives
-Buffing crew health and damage
-Making orphix missions easier, A LOT easier
-Changing railjack missions so they are more ""Original""
-Making enemies smarter

Ever since the Wisp Prime update, I can't use my DualSense without runing into many issues, and now that I have a Dualsense Edge, it seems to get worse.

 My main issues here are as follows:

[list]
[*]Gyro goes crazy whenever I switch between melee and guns. You can replicate this by having anything that trigger Gyro turning it on, and then switching Action Sets; for instance, set your Gyro to turn on when you hold any button, then hold said button and move your controller, and then do a quick melee.

[*]For whatever reason I can't understand, I can't hack any console because I use Circle for ""Context Menu"" and Square for ""Quick Melee"", but Circle is also ""Back"" on the damn Menu action set, which for whatever reason triggers as soon as the game switches to said action set (which is as soon as I start hacking resulting on an instant cancel).

[*]I can't use Legacy signals (i.e. assing a button to be an Xbox controller button) for whatever reason; whenever I try it sends absolutely no signal and renders useless said button.

[*]Also, I can't get rid of Melee Action Set because for some reason, It will be back as an empty setup, which means my controller dies as soon as I switch to melee (even with a quick melee)

 As far as I can tell, these issues are on Valve's regard since I've seen them happen on other games that use Native Input (No Man's Sky), and I've exposed these issues to the community and DE in various ways, but it seems to be a useless endeavor, so if anyone knows a way to work around these issues or fix them, I'd like to know.

 Thanks for your attention.","en","-","Native Input Help[H1]Warning: If your solution is just using an Xbox Controller without Steam input, then don't bother commenting. Also, no third party software solutions please, I don't want to switch to one of these ONLY for Warframe.[\/H1]

Ever since the Wisp Prime update, I can't use my DualSense without runing into many issues, and now that I have a Dualsense Edge, it seems to get worse.

 My main issues here are as follows:

[*]Gyro goes crazy whenever I switch between melee and guns. You can replicate this by having anything that trigger Gyro turning it on, and then switching Action Sets; for instance, set your Gyro to turn on when you hold any button, then hold said button and move your controller, and then do a quick melee.

When you enter the Undercroft, you become locked inside without any missions or objectives. If it forces you to QUIT and LEAVE Duviri, your progress is wasted.

3. AFTER KILLING JACKAL (DUVIRI CIRCUIT), YOU GET STUCK INSIDE. Nothing happens, no prompts, and no progress.","en","-","DUVIRI EXPERIENCE AND CIRCUIT CURRENT BUGSEven with the recent bug fixes in the Duviri Circuit and Duviri Experience, there are still unresolved issues that continue to frustrate players, especially those who dedicate time and resources to grinding DUVIRI. Time and Resources are being wasted because of these persistent bugs, as they persist even after the latest Duviri Bug Patches. Below is the list of the ANNOYING BUGS PLAYERS ARE EXPERIENCING.

Even using a controller, it won't let me select the password input box.

 One solution to this might be creating a ""save password"" box, which is a risk I could decide for myself if I want to take.

 I looked up if somebody had already found a solution to this. One person said they opened Starbound mod uploader in another window before opening Warframe and that fixed it for them. I'm not sure how that would work for me.","en","-","Password input doesn't work when opening in Steam VR theaterI don't know if it's Steam VR's fault or Warframe's fault, but when I open Warframe in Steam VR's theater mode (it's just a big screen display) it opens, but then it defaults to controller input.

Now, just before I say anything, i'm very new to the game (got it for my birthday last week) and I have NO IDEA where this happened. All I know is that I was scavenging some homes next to the coast when I saw 4 or 5 deer just frozen in place.

 I was able to kill each and every one of them, but there were no sound effects from them, nor were there any reactions to the hits I gave them. When one of them died, their body dissappeared in thin air and no meat was left behind. Little blood spurts would pop out when I hit said deer as well. They died within maybe 4 or 5 hits with a damaged kitchen knife, but they were seemingly invulnerable to my unarmed attacks. 

 Not sure if this is a known bug, or if this only happens with the deer, but I thought I should bring it up for future notice and fixing.

Oye, no tanto para mí como para mi hermano, a quien realmente le encanta este juego, pero nos hemos encontrado con un problema realmente molesto:

Cada vez que intenta iniciarlo, el juego tiene audio normal hasta que se carga. A veces hay una especie de sonido de clic agudo y eso es todo, todo el audio simplemente desaparece. Sin respirar, sin correr, zombies, disparos, nada.

Hemos intentado utilizar diferentes dispositivos de audio, audífonos, audífonos, parlantes, etc., pero no producen sonido. Cuando inicias en la pantalla del personaje, el audio es totalmente normal, suena la música y todo. Sólo cuando lo cargas realmente el sonido se detiene. Cuando vuelves al menú de personajes, el sonido *no* regresa y continúa desapareciendo. Reiniciar el juego permitirá que se recupere el audio, pero solo hasta que vuelvas a jugar.

Es más, podemos confirmar que sólo el sonido del juego se ve afectado, y sólo en DayZ. Otros juegos de Steam, juegos de Origin e incluso videos de YouTube pueden reproducirse en segundo plano, aún produciendo sonido, incluso reproduciéndose en DayZ, pero DayZ no hace ningún ruido.

Además de probar hardware diferente, intenté actualizar DirectX, incluso directamente desde el archivo y desde un navegador web. También intenté eliminar archivos .cab como sugirió un lugar, y también verifiqué para asegurarme de que estén seleccionados los dispositivos de audio correctos y que la aplicación no esté silenciada.

También intenté desinstalar y reinstalar el juego, pero no tuvo ningún efecto.

Nuevamente, otros juegos funcionan bien, los dispositivos de audio funcionan bien, es específicamente DayZ y nada más. ¿Alguien tiene alguna idea sobre qué podría solucionarlo? Pasé todo el día navegando por la web en busca de respuestas, profundizando lo suficiente en los resultados de búsqueda de Google como para encontrar Roblox, así que no creo que vaya a encontrar la respuesta allí, pero si alguien que tiene más conocimientos de tecnología que yo ( Lo cual no es decir mucho) podría ayudarnos, se lo agradeceríamos mucho.","es","No sound after entering the game?

HI i really HAVE  annoying problem:

Whenever i trie to start it up, the game has normal audio up until the game loads in. Sometimes there's a sharp sort of click sound, and that's it, all the audio is just gone. No breathing, running, zombies, gunshots, nothing.

We've tried using different audio devices, earbuds, headphones, speakers etc., but they are not producing sound. When you start up onto the character screen, the audio is totally normal, the music plays and everything. It's only when you actually load in that the sound stops. When you exit back to the character menu, the sound *does not* return, and continues to be gone. Restarting the game will allow the audio back, but only until you actually play again.

What's more, we can confirm that it is only the sound in the game that is affected, and only in DayZ. Other Steam games, Origin games, and even youtube videos can play in the background, still producing sound, even playing over DayZ, but DayZ does not make any noise.

In addition to trying different hardware, I've tried updating DirectX, including straight from the file, and from a web browser. I've also tried deleting .cab files as one place suggested, and I've also checked to make sure the correct audio devices are selected, and that the application isn't muted.

I also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, but it had no effect.

Again, other games work fine, the audio devices work fine, it is specifically DayZ and nothing else. Does anyone have any ideas about what could fix it?","en","-","I HAVE AUDIO PROBLEMS PLEASE HELPNo sound after entering the game?

I am even cant pickup ammo or some weapon too kill them, because they respawn TOO FAST. I think respawn minimun in 10-20 minutes its ok, but not in 60-120 sec.

I have checked spawn point for this locations, am I have not move too far, I have been very close, so its imposible that I have triggered that twice or more times.

On many another locations 1-2 tiers zombies respawn much slower, I even have time to pickup some goods and go out of location.","en","-","Zombies on some locations respawn TOO FASTHello, I am new in Dayz.

In-game items are inactive, so I can't get them into my character's hands and I can't use them. Every now and then I get kicks from the server and I get errors 0x00030002 and I can't log in to the server ... The buttons in the game menu are not active, I press play to log in to the server and nothing happens.

"DayZ","Shooter","NuclearDude97","0","Black screen/Hard reboot","en","-","The game worked perfectly the first day, but since then I can't play this game because it crashes my pc on a black screen, sometimes with the gpu fan at full speed (on the black screen). Only a hard reboot works to get my pc going again, on the first time my pc took 4 times longer to restart, with a weird black screen and a circle spinning. I can play games with higher system requirements than Dayz without any problem. I also noticed that Dayz heats up my cpu more than other games (70°~75°), I have games that struggle to run, but don't heat up my cpu that much (50°~60°). I did a quick test (about 40 minutes), and apparently, when playing at the lowest preset the black screen problem disappeared (temperature still 70°+), but we started having connection problems frequently, my friend was hosting and even he was being kicked off his server (that's why I couldn't test more). Certainly these constant sudden crashes\/shutdowns and hard reboots are not healthy for the hardware and the lowest preset isn't the most pleasant to play with. So now me and my friend are too scared to risk it.

Game Ver. 1.21 (stable)
Steps to reproduce: Join a private server and play normally on default graphics quality. (High I believe). It can take more than an hour or 10 minutes to happen. It seems that when it starts to happen, it keeps happening with an interval of about 15 minutes

Wolves only headshot\/deal damage to the head hitbox of the body and only damage clothes located on the face eg: masks, helmets, glasses etc. This was not the case in previous patches as wolf damage would be directed to the main body mass eg: chest\/stomach with the clothing\/armor items present in those area's being damaged accordingly.

Also another instance of this bug or potentially a second bug involving wolves is their interesting interaction of one shotting\/instantly killing a full armored player from full health
(Perhaps a result of the headshot only issue with wolves? damage to the brain hitbox perhaps? resulting in instant death as per the body hitbox mechanics?) Who knows.

"DayZ","Shooter","clair2lunes","1","No interaction with some objects (small pot of food, compass, vitamin, flash light, medecine...)","en","-","Hi 
I  bought recently DayZ and I find myself confronted with a lot of bugs which considerably hinder my gameplay. 
I no longer have the very first bug which prevented me from turning right, I could only turn in one direction. I uninstalled, re-installed the game several times, changed my mouse, I went into full screen mode, and finally this problem that made the game unplayable was resolved (I don't really know how).

But now I have another problem: I can't use many items in the game.
Again, I uninstalled the game several times to reinstall it, and my problem persists: I can't interact with some objects, which prevents me from playing the game correctly.
For example, I starved to death when I I had a small jar of food in my hands, but I couldn't open it (and it wasn't canned food but a small jar of dough). I had the mouse icon on the bottom left of the screen with ""open"" noted, the icon was showing the left mouse button. I tried to hold it, nothing happened. The same goes for compasses, vitamins, and even putting wood in a fireplace to make a fire when I had all the necessary equipment. What bothers me is that it worked once or twice, but it doesn't work anymore. I had the objects in hand for all these cases. 

I tried to associate another button for the object action (for example the ""u"" key on my keyboard at random), nothing happens when I press it either.
I add that I did not install any mod, just the game as it is offered.

Thank you for your attention, and hoping that there is a solution to my problem.","en","-","No interaction with some objects (small pot of food, compass, vitamin, flash light, medecine...)Hi

I feel like the issue is frame rate pacing I have high fps in most cases locked at 144 at 1440p till get into towns on the coast like chemo where I will drop to the low 60s. My inland fps is fine.

Anyone else get these, i know other people on the server im on have these problems, its vanillia with no mods and only happened with the new vehicle update.","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/221100/discussions/5/3598968030055309267/","26/11/22 18:56","18/01/2024 11:28:56","Bug Report"

1. High Ping: Ich habe immer wieder Ping Probleme. Jedoch NUR in DAYZ. Nach ca. ner Stunde werde ich auch immer wegen dem high ping dann mal gekickt. Es kommt und geht.

2. Performance Probleme: auf egal welchen grafiksettings habe ich durchgehend micro fps drops. So läuft das Spiel sehr flüssig, aber immer wieder nach allen paar minuten bekomme ich mikroruckler bis zu nen kurzen standbild. also ca. auch so wie beim high ping problem.

Diese Probleme treten absolut nur bei DayZ auf, selbst das neue Modern Warfare 2 läuft problemlos flüssig und gar ohne ruckler. also an meiner hardware kann es nicht liegen. und ich habe eine sehr gute internet verbindung, bei anderen games hab ich immer einen guten ping. 

Hat jemand diese Probleme schon mal gehabt & kennt da vlt nen fix für?

Vlt. can help me one of you. 1. High Ping: I always have ping problems. However, ONLY in DAYZ. After about an hour I get kicked because of the high ping then. It comes and goes. 2. Performance problems: on whatever graphics settings I have micro fps drops throughout. So the game runs very smoothly, but again and again after every few minutes I get micro-ruckler up to a short standing image. so about as with the high ping problem. These problems occur absolutely only at DayZ, even the new Modern Warfare 2 runs smoothly and even without a jerker. so it can't be due to my hardware. and I have a very good internal connection, with other games I always have a good ping.

Я решил зайти на другой сервер официальный и ситуация повторилась, тот же лут при мне, я решил перепроверить это, выстрелив из оружия и оставил 5 патрон в магазине, зашел на следующий сервер и там тот же лут при мне и то же количество патронов (5) в магазине.

OR

See tin of unlabeled food > take tin to inventory > immediately get wound infection symptoms with the blurred vision\/ pain noise plus the bio disease icon

Put iodine or alcohol tincture in hands as soon as I have the symptoms it will not let me treat any wounds so it isn't behaving like normal wound infection

The disease does not respond to tetracycline (20+ taken) or charcoal tabs. (5 taken)

I cannot eat or drink in normal amounts without vomiting like cholera or salmenollosis - but this isn't listed as a symptom of wound infection

I would have expected possibly salmonellosis or cholera from these actions (eating raw meat or touching an infected food can) but not wound infection

Curing normal wound infection with tinctures. or later with tetracycline works fine!","en","-","Wound infection symptoms caught from foodEDIT

[h1]Rules for the bug forum and how to report a bug[\/h1]
[olist]
[*]When posting a bug in the forums, please make sure that it has not been reported before or that a suitable solution has been listed in the rest of this thread. Please use the search function first.
[*]Check if the bug has been listed in the “Known Issues” thread and the “Confirmed Bugs” thread. Also use the search function to see if it’s already been reported.
[*]If the issue has been reported, see if you have anything to add to that report. If possible please include a screenshot or a video.
[*]When writing your report, please be as thorough as possible when explaining the situation, any detail might be helpful. The more information you provide the more likely it is that we can find the problem. We need to be able to reproduce the issue in the office before we can fix the issue.
[*]A crash is slightly different, they may seem similar but a crash can be caused by so many different reasons that it is better to always post them in their own thread. If your crash is related to another crash we may merge the threads. First try to resolve your problem with the solutions posted in the pinned threads, and if that doesn’t work, post it in your own thread.
[*]Avoid posting multiple bugs in the same post, please keep each post about one issue. This helps us with both communication and testing. It is also easier when posting in the Confirmed Bugs thread, a thread with a collection of issues are less likely to get a post there.
[*]Please add a tag to the title on the post to help specify the type of issue. please use the following tags: 
[list]
[*][ART: *LEVEL NAME*]  for clipping and texture issues in level as well as placement of props.
[*][GAME PLAY: *LEVEL NAME*] for issues related to how the interactions and objectives work.
[*][COLLISIONS: *LEVEL NAME*] for clipping and collisions issues related to the player character.
[*][WEAPON: *WEAPON NAME*] for art issues on weapons
[*][SKIN: *WEAPON NAME*] for art issues on weapon skins please include the skin name in the title.
[*][STATS] for issues with stats on weapons
[*][SKILLS] for issues regarding the skills
[*][PERK DECK] for issues regarding the perk decks
[*][CRASH] for crashes
[*][ART] Other art related issues, like characters
[*][AI] for issues related to AI, for pathing issues please include the level name in the title
[*][SOUND] for issues related to sound effects or voice lines
[*]You can, if you wish, change the tile to include a [Fixed] once the issue has been resolved, this will not be done by forum moderators since it may invoke unwanted attention to the thread. 
[\/list]
[*]Finally when you do post a bug Make the title as descriptive as possible it helps us understanding the issue and other player finding it.
[\/olist]

[h1]How we handle posts[\/h1]
[olist]
[*]New issues, This is a bug that has not been reported before and is unknown to us here as Overkill. Once the issue has been tested it will appear in the Confirmed Bugs sticky thread with a short description of the bug and a link to the thread. When a fix has been made and included in a patch a note will be added to the post in the Confirmed Bugs sticky thread saying “This is now fixed”. The next time the game is patched any post in the Confirmed Bugs sticky thread with a “This is now fixed” note will be removed, the associated thread will be locked but will remain in the forum.

[*]Old bugs that resurface, These bugs are best posted in new threads, Referring to the old and\/or locked thread is fine if the a user so wishes. The new report should still be treated like a new issue.

[*]Issues that do not require a patch, for example; Crashes related to Hardware, Drivers or other software. Issues confirmed to be mod related. Issues where the thread owner has misunderstood an achievement or game-play element. These issues will not appear in the Confirmed Bugs thread. The threads will be dealt with on a case by case basis. They may be left open for other users to ask questions on how to solve the same or similar issues or that may be locked on the thread owners, moderators or Overkill staff’s request if the issue is resolved. 

[*]Known Issues and bugs, Sometimes a lot of reports may be posted about the same issue. These issues will be handled in three different ways. We will try to reply to as many as possible but we might not be able to reply to all of them. We will try to merge threads with new and relevant information. If there is no new information in the thread we will ether ask for more information in case the user has anything more to add to the related issue. Sometimes we may lock threads if we feel there is no need to merge and we have all the information we need. A link to the currently active thread about the issue should be provided.
[\/olist]

The only threads that will be deleted will be so with the approval from, or request of the owner of the thread. We will strive for locking rather than deleting, we do reserve our self the right to lock without prior confirmation it cases this was needed. A thread can be deleted without prior confirmation if it's needed due to general forum rules. Threads will be locked with the intention of not having new posts be made in them and new reports should be make instead but the old thread can still be found and referred to.

All this is to keep the forum easy to navigate both for us here at Overkill and the users in the forum. This is not about removing unwanted threads it's about making our work easier and faster.

Like I said in the title, the game keeps crashing when I press on the controls tab in the options menu or when I press the button to put on my mask in the heists.
Down below I have put the crashlog with exemple the first one.
Can someone help me with this? Because I can not findout what the problem is.

Which from what I have read is a very generic crash that points to the ram or the gpu.  Things I have currently tried are:
Removed mods, reinstalled many times first deleting anything mod related and then the payday 2 folder before uninstalling then reinstalling, verifying game files, reinstalling gpu driver first using ddu and also isntalling the driver only without the radeon software,  reinstalling windows(without removing apps or files so maybe didn't help but I would rather not do this if possible), ran sfc and the disms, reinstalled all relevant drivers, uninstalled any programs that potentially conflict and also epic, tried -steamMM, running as admin and with every different windows compatibility mode, tried the fixes and anticrash, tried older gpu drivers, some launch commands that might change the dx version, restarting the computer many times, disabled discord overlay, disabled steam overlay.
I have tried most of these things several times and in many different combinations but have always gotten the same exact result which has been very frustating.  I have only gotten it to launch in 3 circumstances: when my display adapter is disabled, in windows safe mode, when my gpu driver is not installed.  These all are probably the same situation though.  Obviously this does not make the game very playable.  Vr also seems to be working.  Only other relevant information I can think to mention is I have a AMD 6900 XT and recently upgraded to windows 11, the last time it was working was before the upgrade.  And that this is not occurring in any other game I have tried.  I appreciate any help I can get.","en","-","[CRASH] on launch, vr or disabling display adapter worksOk so i've spent 15+ hours and 3 sleepless nights trying to fix payday and I have got a strange issue.

No mods installed, just had a runtime error crash.

W10
i7-3700
1660s
16gb RAM

All other heists(so far) work fine.
I've also reset my progress, uninstalled skins, pretty much anything I've seen suggested short of uninstall and reinstall.

Finally gave in and uninstalled\/reinstalled. Seemed to fix whatever was bugging it.","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/14/4039231211454441675/","27/12/23 16:22","18/01/2024 11:35:59","Bug Report"

пробовал выключить дискорд перед включением игры
удалил все моды
проверял кэш игры 
устанавливал фиксы: BlackMarketManager._get_weapon_stats и The Fixes
всё это пробовал и ничего не помогало

I need some help with constant game crushing.
I've played for 90 hours already and for some time now (I guess, last 10 hours or so) the game started crushing on some missions unexpectedly (no correlation with which type of missions). And it crashes to the point that I have to reboot my computer altogether.
I don't have any mods, just some DLCs.
And I've already reinstalled the game, which didn't help one bit.
All crushlogs look more or less the same (only this script stack is smth new), you can see the last one above:

I have tried a many things from reinstalling video drivers, directx, .net. physx and vcredist for example.

I really don't know what to try anymore. The only clue I have about the crash is that if I try to start it in VR it works. Sadly VR is in a very poor state and unplayable.

I was having a similar problem with Hoxton Breakout when it was in Christmas form that appears to have been fixed by a hotpatch, is there some Christmas variation of this heist that is screwing me over or something else?

what keeps on happening is I  go to launch the game it starts to launch, then just stops. no pop-up, no window for the game, nothing, and i have no idea what to do, but i was told i can paste my crashlog and some one might help. so im trying that. also i have uninstalled all mods in mod folder and in mod-override.

SO BASICALLY here's what happens:
I load up a heist, everything seems normal. I start the heist and I get the little dialogue screen with the difficulty and stuff; yknow, the thing right before you get put in the heist? Once that runs its course, the screen goes black, freezes for a few seconds, and crashes.

I'll post my full crashlog below. Something to note:

I don't have ANY mods. None. Just pure vanilla PD2.
I don't have any software that's incompatible (I'm 97% sure, checked the list and everything)
My antivirus is Malwarebytes Free + Windows Defender.
I tried running it in Compatibility mode for Windows 7. No dice.

and now for the crash log:

If anybody can get me a fix to this I'll thank you for all eternity. Otherwise I guess i just can't play payday 2 again until i get a new computer.","en","-","Payday hates me and i dont know why (Payday 2 Crashing)Hello everybody, making what's probably the 50,000th post on this because I genuinely cannot find a solution to this.

SO BASICALLY here's what happens:
I load up a heist, everything seems normal. I start the heist and I get the little dialogue screen with the difficulty and stuff; yknow, the thing right before you get put in the heist? Once that runs its course, the screen goes black, freezes for a few seconds, and crashes.

I'll post my full crashlog below. Something to note:

I don't have ANY mods. None. Just pure vanilla PD2.
I don't have any software that's incompatible (I'm 97% sure, checked the list and everything)
My antivirus is Malwarebytes Free + Windows Defender.
I tried running it in Compatibility mode for Windows 7. No dice.

and now for the crash log:

Back in the day the game occasionally crashed on only 2 heists, I believe those were the white house and border crossing and it only happened when playing online. I have fixed it several times with changing a few settings and upgrading every single thing I could upgrade but after a while heists start to crash online again.
in fact, every time the issues come back they get worse and I am now on the point that basically every single heist has a high chance to crash and EVEN OFFLINE heists have started to crash. Crashlog always has stuff like ""Application has crashed: access violation"" but the last time it was ""Application has crashed: single step"" whatever that means.

and I KNOW turning the graphics quality from high to medium probably prevents it but high quality is already not that great to look at and if I put it on medium I get headaches and nausea much faster than usual so for me it makes the game unplayable. Removing my few mods also never helped.

CrimeNet no longer sorts Crimesprees out from normal heists. This happens right as CrimeNet goes to refresh the lobby pool.
https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=2993194566

Bug 2:
When launching the game, it will display whatever the filter was previously set to. Changing the heist type filter will not remove the previous heists, and instead adds them to the current heist pool.
https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=2993190434

Bug 3:
Holdout absolutely breaks CrimeNet. If you switch to Holdout, you will be [b]removed[\/b] from matchmaking. All lobbies will be removed, and switching back to any other heist type returns no results. Quick play will still function, but only for regular heists.

Once you close the CrimNet menu and reopen it, you will be [b]fully removed[\/b] from matchmaking. Quickplay will no longer function. 

Sometimes you can fix it be switching around the filter fast enough. Sometimes it's the Crimespree filter that does this instead of holdout. It frequently happens, but hard to perfectly reproduce.

     Whenever I attempt to drop a sentry in the back area where the vault spawns, not in the vault itself, either the sentry drops or it doesn't. Regardless, after that I can no longer drop any more sentries. I have used ammo bags, tried having my other gun selected, picked up ammo off the ground to full, reloaded my main weapons; nothing works. I can pick the guns back up but from that point on I can no longer place them even if I return to earlier portions of the map.

I purchased the original base game a long time ago and am getting back into it but I cannot figure out anyway to purchase the legacy collection. I tried removing the game from Steam (uninstall and remove from library via Steam support), but I still could not purchase the collection. There seems to be no way to purchase the collection if you already have the base game. I was able to purchase it and gift it to a friend, but I have not been able to purchase it for myself and I would like to.

I've been noticing that the game crashes on some heists that has either different cop designs (Murkywater\/Mexican forces) or map layout and it happens on most of them with overkill difficulty or above which is interesting.

These heists are as follows:

1- Brooklyn Bank - Overkill+
2- Henry's Rock - Overkill+
3- The White House - Normal+
4- Border Crossing - Overkill+
5- Border Crystals - Overkill+
6- San Martin Bank - Overkill+
7- Breakfast In Tijuana - Overkill+
8- Buluc's Mansion Overkill+
9- Dragon Heist - Normal+
10- The Ukrainian Prisoner - Normal+
11- Black Cat - Normal+
12- Mountain Master - Normal+

Now what's interesting on these heists that crash on overkill difficulty or above is that the medic police force comes in on these difficulties which begs the question does he have an error code or something that crashes the game on high graphics quality?

I'll leave the answer to you developers to fix this problem.

By the way don't ask me about my system requirements because it's 5x the game's recommended system requirements.","en","-","Game crashes with high texture quality on a specific heists.This issue been happening to a lot of people and I'm here to discuss about it because it's a serious issue that makes the game unstable for how old it is.

"PAYDAY 2","Shooter","ManaCloak of The Wind","0","Console bug, loot disappearing. (CRIMEWAVE EDITION POST)","en","-","Hello! So my luck is absolutely ♥♥♥♥, I barely get to play the PC version of the game (about 1-2 months a year), I want to tell you a massive bug in hopes of it deterring you from playing the console versions.

If someone who isn’t the host grabs a bag of loot, they can flat out delete that bag if they try to throw it. The chance of it happening seems to be their connection\/distance to the host (desync, I believe it’s called?), as playing with friends who live near me seems to never reproduce this issue. It’s even worse on Xbox, as people can pay Microsoft monthly to play the game, meaning you’re going to run into new players unaware of the bug way, way more.

Solutions : 
1. Monitor who can join, an infamy player with some DLC is more likely to know and let you handle loot when compared to JoePinky4209. The best way to do this is to set ‘Drop In’ to PROMPT, as this is the only way to see someone’s loadout while in the middle of a heist. It will tell you their weapons, level, armor, deployable, perk deck and deck level. 

2. Grab more loot, this applies to both Crime Spree and regular play, if there’s more loot than needed to finish the heist then you’re less likely to lose a bag and get softlocked. (This only applies to heists like Beneath The Mountain) I know it sounds stupid, but you’d be surprised how many times a level 60 will grab a masterpiece in Crime Spree and end up locking the heist because you can’t get back down.
Don’t be afraid to kick anyone you may deem too new or a Microsoft “Gamepass” subscriber, they’ll probably die grabbing all the optional loot or kill all your hostages due to using an RPG at point blank or something. Please just buy the PC version of this game if you have everything needed to play it.

Unfortunately for die-hard console users, this will not be fixed as they stopped working on the console ports years ago. Now can anyone tell me how to fix my USB? I want to come back to PC PAYDAY 2.","en","-","Console bug, loot disappearing. (CRIMEWAVE EDITION POST)Hello!

[h3]PlayStation 5 Costumers:[\/h3]
* The correct version of PD3 was just rolled out [url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/PAYDAYGame\/status\/1704065716243038531]11:30 CET\/02:30PDT\/05:30EDT\/18:30JST[\/url] - 
---------------------------------------


[h3]Infamous\/Milestone rewards\/redemption issue PD2 > PD3:[\/h3]
1. [strike]Should be solved at or before launch.[\/strike] [i](This might resolve once the servers have been fixed)[\/i].
[u]Make sure you have claimed your rewards on the website.[\/u]
[i](If you can't claim then restart PD2 and have the game open for a few minutes)[\/i]
---------------------------------------


[h3]If you are having issues with Matchmaking for over 10 minutes:[\/h3]
1. Restart your game.
2. Opt out of Crossplay.
3. Add and invite people, refer to [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/1272080\/discussions\/3\/]Steam LFG[\/url] or discord.
4. [strike]Server's are overloaded.[\/strike] (They're doing as massive effort in fixing the servers).
---------------------------------------


[h3]Inventory issues\/perks\/Sentries ect:[\/h3]
- [I]In the game lobby you have to equip your loadout by pressing ""R"". (Thanks to Yuri Keller)[\/I]
1. Try restarting your game or see Loadout below.
2. Equip default mask & restart your game [i](Thanks Charsjust)[\/i]
3. Tooltips are incorrect - In other words lvl up more (lvl 12-18 has been said to unlock stuff).
4. Server's might need to update your progress.
5. Playing a few more heists might also help
6. Its a bug.
- The server's are likely the culpit.
---------------------------------------


[h3]Loadout locked\/invalidated & unable to swap character:[\/h3]
1. Complete the first mission [i](Thanks to timmy)[\/i]
2. Buy the weapon slot(s).
3. Restart your game after 1 & 2. [i](thanks to N4D1N3 for confirming)[\/i]
4. Verify game files.
Otherwise you can try finding a workaround or wait till a fix is implemented.
[i][u](Silver or gold ED does not affect this issue)[\/u][\/i]

[h3]Not receiving any Experience(EXP):[\/h3]
1. Completing Challenges gives you Infamy Points(EXP). [i](Thanks to Nuko & Mordtziel)[\/i]
---------------------------------------


[h3]Resolution workarounds:[\/h3]
1. Set the game to full-screen & restart the game. [i](Thanks to Tipsy McStagger)[\/i]
2.  Right click desktop > display > set scaling to 100% then restart game if you need to. [i](Thanks to Alex)[\/i]
3. Edit the game file, [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/1272080\/discussions\/0\/5291222824586125039\/]see this tread[\/url]
---------------------------------------


[h3]If you can't download the game having purchased Silver or Gold Package:[\/h3]
[i]- Still having Beta installed could be the Culprit? [\/i]
1. Restart steam multiple times [b](make sure steam is closed in the task manager)[\/b].
2. Update steam: ""Steam"" top right corner > Check for Steam Client Updates > Restart steam like step 1 once.
3. Log out & back in to Steam.
4. Use the Mobile App to download PD3. [i](Some have said this works and doesn't work)[\/i].
5. Repeat 1 until it works.
6. Open a support ticket with steam.
[i]- Steam is most likely overloaded or some other steam EA issue.[\/i]
---------------------------------------

[h3]Game is running but nothing happens[\/h3]
[B] If your game is launched\/running and there is no visual change or the application doesn't start\/pop up apart from a blue spinning wheel for 10-30sec or launches after a while (+10mins) and blackscreens try deleting OpenXR: ""Payday3 folder > Engine > Binaries > ThirdParty > Delete ""OpenXR"""".  [\/B] If that doesn't work, run both Steam & PD3 exe's with ""Run as admininstrator"" compatability. [i](Verifying the files will just recover OpenXR so don't do that. and IF THAT doesn't work then refer to below.)[\/i]

[h3]If you can't install\/run the game:[\/h3]
[b]Notice: [\/b] [i]Running 2 GPU's\/Multi-monitor set-up can be the issue due to driver(s) (see the last thread in Sources ""GPU\/VR"").[\/i]
0. Disable Overlays (E.g Geforce, xbox, discord, VR)
1. Run steam as Administrator.
2. Run Payday 3 as Administrator.
3. Set -dx12 or -dx11 as launch parameters. [i](Try both, DX12 is not supported but can still work)[\/i]
4. Remove ""Read-Only"" from your Steam folder(if you install games on another drive repeat that there as well)\/game folder.
5. Double check your harddrive(s) so they aren't almost full.
6. Clear steam cache (In Settings > Download).
7. Add the game\/folder to the Firewall.
8. Check so your antivirus aren't interfering.
9. Verify the game cache.
10. Reinstall the game.
11. Try installing the game in C: (Sometimes this works) or an SSD.  - [i](Thanks to Ο ΚΑΘΑΡΗΣΤΗΣ).[\/i]
12. Repair windows (scanhealth)
13. Double check your Bios version is up to date.
14. Make sure you have Chipset, lan ect drivers for your Motherboard
15. Restarting your PC could solve the issue.
Finally double check you're not missing Directx12 or Visual Studio or that your other drivers are up-to-date.
* [strike][i]Nvidia is working on a solution for Epic Games users, contact Nvidia if you have issues. [\/i][\/strike]  [b] Nvidia handed out a driver update to fix that problem.[\/b]
- If all else fails and googling doesn't help i recommend a [b]Clean Windows Install[\/b] ([u]Your windows install could be faulty.[\/u] Clean Install means formating\/deleting the C:\ drive and its partitions then pressing ""New"" on the same harddrive afterwards).  
{MAKE SURE YOU [b]DON'T[\/b] FORMAT\/DELETE YOUR OTHER HARDDRIVES! There's plenty guides on google.}
---------------------------------------


[h3]If the game is crashing\/lag\/stutter:[\/h3]
[i]- For unknown\/access violation see 7.[\/i]
1. Change Liberty mask to something else (It can crash ur game due to Directx12) [i][Thanks to JL\/Underdrill][\/i]
2. Set -dx12 or -dx11 as launch parameters. - [i]Some have said dx12 can cause performance issues\/unable to start the game as DX12 isn't supported.[\/i]
3. Shaders could be the culprit.
4. Turn down Shadows setting.
5. Enable V-sync.
6. Verify the integrity of the game files.
7. Restart your PC. [i](Thanks to Xaanit)[i]
6. Turn down everything to the lowest settings
7. Open Nvidia Control Panel  > ""Manage 3D Settings"" > Restore Defaults.
8. UE has a thing where you stutter the first time of occurrence.
[i](Special thanks to Chickenburger)[\/i]
8. Try one of the run\/install solutions above.
---------------------------------------


[h3]Nebula Error Login workaround:[\/h3]
[b]- I want to add that due to the servers being overloaded [i](They are fixing them and as a result you are likely going to experience this error.)[\/i], its entirely possible this workaround is irrelevant. [\/b]
1. Restart your game.
[strike]2. Remove 2nd auth temporarily.[\/strike] [i]- [url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/PAYDAYGame\/status\/1704889522121531841]This should be resolved.[\/url][\/i]
3. [strike]Log in to the Nebula > Unlink steam account > Restart Payday 3 > Create a new Nebula account in the game > close the Neubla Window without Linking > Log in. (Thanks to BabyDontBlockMe)[\/strike] - [b]This is no longer relevant and all ur stuff is linked to ur account. [\/b]
4. Contact support: https:\/\/nebula.starbreeze.com\/support
 [i][b]Nebula Support is ONLY in regards to your Nebula account.[\/b][\/i] 
---------------------------------------


If all above fails then it could be some other reason that i do not know of and strongly advice to go to their Bug forums or creating a support ticket (hyperlink at the start).

[i](I am unaffiliated with Starbreeze and these aren't solutions or fixes, they're meant to try to pinpoint the possible culprit to what might be causing your problem while hopefully solving it. Additionally quite a few of the problems might be solved when the serves are working properly.)[\/i]

[b]- I want to add that due to the servers being overloaded [i](They are fixing them and as a result you are likely going to experience this error.)[\/i], its entirely possible this workaround is irrelevant. [\/b]
1. Restart your game.
[strike]2. Remove 2nd auth temporarily.[\/strike] [i]- [url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/PAYDAYGame\/status\/1704889522121531841]This should be resolved.[\/url][\/i]
3. [strike]Log in to the Nebula > Unlink steam account > Restart Payday 3 > Create a new Nebula account in the game > close the Neubla Window without Linking > Log in. (Thanks to BabyDontBlockMe)[\/strike] - [b]This is no longer relevant and all ur stuff is linked to ur account. [\/b]
4. Contact support: https:\/\/nebula.starbreeze.com\/support
 [i][b]Nebula Support is ONLY in regards to your Nebula account.[\/b][\/i] 
---------------------------------------


If all above fails then it could be some other reason that i do not know of and strongly advice to go to their Bug forums or creating a support ticket (hyperlink at the start).

[i](I am unaffiliated with Starbreeze and these aren't solutions or fixes, they're meant to try to pinpoint the possible culprit to what might be causing your problem while hopefully solving it. Additionally quite a few of the problems might be solved when the serves are working properly.)[\/i]

This subforum was created to provide you guys a platform where you can share with us technical issues you encountered when playing Payday 3 through steam, from simple graphical glitches to much more inconvenient problems like crashes or features working incorrectly.

[h1]Rules for the bug report forum and how to report a bug:[\/h1]
 [*] When making a topic in this subforum, please make sure to check if it has not been reported before or that a suitable solution has been listed in the rest of this topic. Please use the search function first.
 [*] Check if the bug has been listed in the “Known Issues” topic. Also use the search function to see if it’s already been reported in case it wasn’t added yet.
 [*] If the issue has been reported, see if you have anything interesting to add to that report. If possible, please include a screenshot or a video.
 [*] When writing your report, please be as thorough as possible when explaining the situation, any detail might be helpful. The more information you provide the more likely it is that the developers can find the problem.
 [*] Avoid posting multiple bugs in the same topic or post if you can please. As much as the idea of one topic handling every bugs is cool, this just makes it confusing for the developers to read, understand and send to each others. One issue per post is really the format we recommend for bug reporting.
 [*] Please add a tag to the title on the post to help specify the type of issue. Here’s some examples of tags you can use: 
	◦	[ART] Art related issues in general, like characters, weapons .
	◦	[ART: *LEVEL NAME*] for clipping and texture issues in level as well as placement of props.
	◦	[GAME PLAY: *LEVEL NAME*] for issues related to how the interactions and objectives work.
	◦	[WEAPON: *WEAPON NAME*] for various issues related to weapons.
	◦	[CRASH] for crashes
	◦	[AI] for issues related to AI issues 
	◦	[SOUND] for issues related to the audio of the game (sound effects or voice lines)
[*] Finally, when you do post a bug make the title as descriptive as possible. It will help both the developers and players to understand what your issue is about.

[h1]How we handle posts:[\/h1]
 [*] New issues: This is a bug that has not been reported before and is unknown to the developers. Once the issue has been tested, it will appear as a post in the Known issues sticky thread with a short description of the bug and a link to the topics of peoples who reported it before. When a fix has been made and included in a patch, the issue will be removed.

 [*] Old bugs that resurface: These bugs are best posted in new threads, Referring to the old and\/or locked thread is fine if the a user so wishes. The new report should still be treated like a new issue.	

 [*] Issues that do not require a patch, for example; Crashes related to Hardware, Drivers or other software. Issues confirmed to be mod related. Issues where the thread owner has misunderstood an achievement or game-play element. These issues will not appear in the Confirmed Bugs thread. The threads will be dealt with on a case by case basis. They may be left open for other users to ask questions on how to solve the same or similar issues or that may be locked on the thread owners, moderators or Overkill staff’s request if the issue is resolved. 
	
 [*] Known Issues and bugs: Sometimes a lot of reports may be posted about the same issue. These issues will be handled in three different ways. We will try to reply to as many as possible but we might not be able to reply to all of them. We will try to merge threads with new and relevant information. If there is no new information in the thread we will ether ask for more information in case the user has anything more to add to the related issue. Sometimes we may lock threads if we feel there is no need to merge and we have all the information we need. A link to the currently active thread about the issue should be provided.

The only threads that will be deleted will be so with the approval from, or request of the owner of the thread. We will strive for locking rather than deleting, we do reserve our self the right to lock without prior confirmation it cases this was needed. A thread can be deleted without prior confirmation if it's needed due to general forum rules. Threads will be locked with the intention of not having new posts be made in them and new reports should be make instead but the old thread can still be found and referred to.

All this is to keep the forum easy to navigate both for us here at Starbreeze and the users in the forum.

So, the usual strat for remotely controlled door is simple - grab white-shirt employee at the basement, bring it to the scanner, he opens the door and you can leave him under the camera. Since noone ever goes these side coridors it's pretty much safe to leave him here.
Or it was

First couple of times when the search was triggered guards ""found"" that employee in a matter of seconds, like 5-10 seconds max - basically insta-alarm, as if they [b]directly walked to him[\/b].
Lesson was learned, all civs were killed(easier to transport) and brought at the top of the stairs under the van location, near the door. Basically a location guard can't ""accidentally"" wander in.

And then the unspeakable happened. At another search triggered - all the guards around went directly from the train yard to that door, like one after another they went up the stairs, directly to the corpses location, ""found"" them and triggered an alarm. Again, in a matter of seconds.

It happens not just [b]consistently[\/b], it happens EVERY TIME. They know where they can trigger the alarm and ruin the heist for you - and they go for it.

[b][CASE 2][\/b]
Happened not once and not even twice, when you loot the train car and leave the bags inside, guards may in some magical way sense them. Looks like this - all doors are closed, bags are deep inside the train car, nothing clips outside (hello clipping bug btw), guard was casually walking around...SUDDENLY he stops, starts menacingly WALK AROUND THE WHOLE TRAIN for like a minute, then walks inside the train car, goes to the far end where the bags were hidden, looks at bags and launches the search.

Which, in turn, causes the guards to go towards nearest civ-body and sound the alarm.

Looks like this - all doors are closed, bags are deep inside the train car, nothing clips outside (hello clipping bug btw), guard was casually walking around...SUDDENLY he stops, starts menacingly WALK AROUND THE WHOLE TRAIN for like a minute, then walks inside the train car, goes to the far end where the bags were hidden, looks at bags and launches the search.

Which, in turn, causes the guards to go towards nearest civ-body and sound the alarm.

1)When you place Zipline at the very beginning, mask up and use it, chances are high servers (hello always online, love to have you) won't recognize your position and throw you from the zipline.

All the files were verified through Steam, and my account shouldn't be the issue because I signed up back with Payday 2. My best guess is it's server trouble, because my firewall is also set to allow Payday 3 through, and it's not my Ethernet dropping out or being slow. Restarting the PC doesn't fix it. So far I've gotten this message all 6-8 times I've tried to start playing Payday 3. Is it some sort of update shenanigans?","Nebula Data Error - Failed to fetch game config dataUpdate: 1 Day later no error. No idea what fixed it, doesn't look like an update on my copy of the game, likely nebula had some technical issues when I first tried to play the game. Very Unluky or a Bad Omen - Though the answer from ""Tera"" indicates bad timing - Wish it had a message to say it was maintenence instead of using other channels but it's not like Payday 2 was flawless and yet I still keep coming back to it because it's such a unique game. Hope #3 won't dissapoint


Had this trouble from the first moment I brought the game yesterday. Was looking forward to playing, but upon starting up the message. Goes to main menu message ""Press any key to start"" - Next Message reads: ""Nebula Data Error"" (In Red) - followed by ""Failed to fetch game config data"" - It gives me two options - ""Return to login"" or ""Quit"" - Return to login brings me to ""Press Any Key to Start"" - Quit being the only button that does what it's supposed to.

I don't know if my computer lag spiked or something, but I became stuck on the ""Getting Ready..."" loading screen on the heist. I couldn't exit the loading screen at all. I couldn't exit the heist without closing the game entirely. 

I sat there until my teammates died and even after that, the game wouldn't restart. I was ""in"" the heist, but my player character wasn't. My player entity had not spawned, but the game still counted me as if I was active in the heist. My teammates couldn't vote to restart the heist, because I couldn't vote since the game flagged me as ""in-game"", nor could they die to restart the heist. It was a soft lock. 

I don't know what caused me to soft lock the game. Maybe it was the loading of the assets that my computer couldn't handle because I've had previous problems with loading in the heist assets, especially on Rock the Cradle. 

I know my computer at least meets the minimum requirements of Payday 3 and I'm running everything on the lowest settings, so I have no idea why this is happening.

I tried to start a match in ""Friends Only"" and ""Invite Only"" and still this game fails to start a game, and I think with myself... why it fails to create a match if this will not match with anyone because it's not a public game. Yeah we got a mistery here.

People say, hey don't be mad at this game, bla bla, they are fixing this, bla bla, give it time...

So, don't launch an unfinished game at full price, at least say hey, this is an alpha version you might find bugs\/issues in the game.

The time I'm finishing typing this text and this took almost 10min because I'm not english native, the game still didn't find any game to play using ""invite only"" for example. So this is the state to start a match right now... that is, not possible.","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/1272080/discussions/4/7342617747180032004/","16/11/23 14:41","18/01/2024 11:47:34","Bug Report"
