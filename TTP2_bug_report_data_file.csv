PINNED:Encountered progress blocker or softlock? Read here!,THE LAW,0,"Hey folks! \nWhile we're on the hunt for those sneaky blockers and softlocks, striving to patch them up as fast as possible, there's always a chance you might stumble upon one. We've put together a handy guide that could assist you in resolving such issues, so why not give it a read? \n\nIf any progress-blocking\/erasing situation happens to you, please still make a thread about it on the \""Tech Support and Bug Reports\"" forum.\nDescribe the issue you have encountered and attach your save game, located in\n[code]...\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Talos2\\Saved\\SaveGames\\[\/code].\nThe save file is named [i]savedata_0\/1\/2.sav[\/i], depending on which game slot card you are playing on. Please upload it to any file hosting service (e.g. Google Drive) and link in the report.\nThis will help us locate the issue and fix it so that it doesn't happen in the future.\n\nAfter that, here are your options of un-locking or restoring your playthrough:\n\n[h3]If you have encoutered a situation where you think the further progression is not possible, but your save file is intact[\/h3]\n\nUse any of the two following methods of unlocking a \""Load checkpoint\"" menu:\n\n[b]Method 1:[\/b]\n1. Go to the Main Menu\n2. While in main menu, press the following key combination on the Numpad (make sure that Num Lock is in the proper state and no buttons are selected): [b]4 6 4 9 7 9 9 9[\/b], that's 8 keys.\n2*. If you're playing with a gamepad (either on PC or on console), the gamepad combination is as follows: [b]LB RB LB RT LT RT RT RT.[\/b] Also 8 keys, should also be pressed in the main menu.\n3. After doing this, open the Play menu. On your savegame, you should be finding a new button called \""Load checkpoint\"".\n\nIf this didn't work, \n[b]Method 2:[\/b]\n(1) Close game\n(2) Open game properties in Steam and in the Launch Options add the following line:\n[code]-ExecCmds=\""Talos.ShowLoadCheckpointMenu 1\""[\/code]\nThen launch the game and you should see that \""Load checkpoint\"" menu.\n\nAfter unlocking the \""Load checkpoint\"" menu using any of these two methods, use it to restore an older checkpoint.\n\n\n[h3]If your save file has visually disappeared, or has been randomly reset to the start of the game[\/h3]\n\n1. Close the game\n2. Locate the save file folder \n[code]...\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Talos2\\Saved\\SaveGames\\[\/code]\n3. Move your current save file out of it. If you are playing on the first save slot card, that is the file [i]savedata_0.sav[\/i], if you're playing on the second card it is [i]savedata_1.sav[\/i] etc.\n4. Locate the backup save files associated with your playthrough, e.g. if you are playing on the second save slot card, they should be named [i]savedata_1_backup_0.sav[\/i] and [i]savedata_1_backup_1.sav[\/i].\n5. Rename the most recently changed backup file between these two to [i]savedata_1.sav[\/i].\n6. Launch the game again, your save should be restored to a slightly outdated backup point.\n7. If this somehow didn't work, try also renaming the other backup save file.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/3936769579826100255/,,,,,,,,The Talos Principle 2

So I launch it with win 8 compatibility.\n\nAfter the game launches there's like 20% chance I will get to the main menu (It very often crashes again on epileplsy warning).\n\nIf I manage to get lucky I get to the menu screen, the game often crashes there as well but If I am lucky it will enter this dizzy mode of displaying main menu at a very low stuttery framerate (around 5 fps).\n\nI have to wait in this dizzyness state in the main menu for about a minute or so and then the fps stabilizes at 120. Only then I am allowed to play the game.\n\nHowever the issue does not stop there, when I finally manage to enter the game it is still not working properly. Whenever I enter a puzzle I am forbidden from holding X to reset it as it is guaranteed to crash it.\n\nAlso whenever I change zones there is like 90% chance of the game crashing which is giga annoying since I am on the golden gate puzzles at the moment - which as you know require frequent zone changes.\n\nI am on a brand new desktop PC and all the other games work fine.\nSpecs:\nMB: Gigabyte Z790 GAMING X AX\nRAM: 2 x 16GB ddr5 6000mhz\nCPU: Intel Core i9-14900KF\nGPU: RTX 4070\n\nI checked the integrity of the files many times and everything seems fine.\n\nWhat is also greatly important I feel like.

Controller / Video Issues,azimuth,7,"Just started up and played for a few minutes, and already running into a few issues. I'm streaming to my TV with the Steam Link app and using an XBox One controller.\n\n1. navigating through menu and changing settings isn't possible, because controller buttons don't do what they say. For example using the shoulder buttons to navigate to different menu tabs doesn't work, so there's no way to access those settings.\n\n2. in-game controller layout is a bit odd. For example 'run' has been moved from left trigger (which has been 'run' in every game for as long as I can remember) to the right shoulder button, which is pretty awkward to use. \n\nI'd love an easy way to go back to the \""classic\"" layout from the first game, which I found much more intuitive. Is there any reason why the old layout wouldn't work? Like are there extra controls that just wouldn't fit in the old scheme?\n\nBeyond the layout, controls are a bit clunky in general. Even a small thing like putting puzzles together seems slow and awkward, compared with the original game where everything just worked. Not sure if that's another controller-specific issue?\n\n3. engine is jittery and glitchy, which is giving me some motion sickness. I have a new-ish computer with decent specs - 13700k, 4070ti, 32GB 5600MHz DDR5, installed on NVMe M.2 SSD - so I expected a better experience in the graphics department - is there an optimization patch in the works? \n\nWhat are recommended settings for a faster, smoother performance if that's all I care about?\n\nIt feels like the original engine was more polished compared to UE5.

In S1-8, the hint for jumping from the cube to the platform in front of the pedestal works crookedly. The orange feet sometimes don\u2019t appear at all, sometimes somewhere on the side, usually on the left - next to the red receiver. And because of this, you have to jump at random. \n15. In S3-5, while the platform is moving, the hero can pass through the bars installed along the edges and fall into the water. If you had a connector in your hands at that moment, you will have to restart the location. \n16. If you put a connector between the power barriers in the \""golden\"" puzzle at E3, then when you try to take it the hero will take extra steps, as if the device was standing too far away.

Bug: South 2: Stowaway + South 1 bug (spiral stair to puzzle),G.S.90s,0,"Spent some tme wandering about, prior to entering, solved area 1, 2, 3. Looked for way to activate green sensor on statue.\n\nAfter entering Stowaway, I tried climbing the ladders, but just as the climbing animation finishes, I am pushed off, somehow. This was the case for both ladders. I restarted from last checkpoint, and that seemed to fix it. Why did this happen? I'm not sure, maybe it's due to long playtime, I've been playing for hours, or perhaps those ladders move slightly somehow.\n\n------------------\nI had solved the level, and tried to move some cubes out, to another level through a distant teleporter. Before I could do so, something happened with one of the cubes. I had placed one cube against the low fence, grabbed another cube, and jumped on top of the cube I had placed. Then, I was going to place the one I held, on the other side of the fence, but instead of doing that, I placed it one the cube I stood on accidentally.\n\nThat caused a weird issue, I could place it, move it, but unable to stand on it, there was no collision on the cube, I could just walk through it. Cube placement worked fine, but there was no colliding for the player. My guess is that the collision hitbox was moved somehow, when I accidentally placed the cube on the one I was standing on.

Motion blur/ghosting - how to completely disable?,OutbackCatgirl (kot),13,"It's  not really possible to show this in a screenshot but *any time* there is motion, I am experiencing a subtle blur effect, most noticeable on foliage, which immediately stops on standing still.

I've tested much older games like HL2 to make sure i'm not just misremembering how motion blur (or a lack of) should look, and that doesn't have this effect, so it's definitely something certain modern games like TP2 have started to have.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/3936769163105970821/,,,,,,,,The Talos Principle 2
