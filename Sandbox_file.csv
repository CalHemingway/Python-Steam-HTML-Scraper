[h1]The game crashes immediately after starting[\/h1]
Make sure your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Search for the latest drivers on GPU Vendor website, don't rely on Windows Update. If you already have the latest driver, you can try to switch to OpenGL renderer using launch option: [code]--force-opengl[\/code]

[h1]Game crashes during startup before loading to the main menu[\/h1]
Your graphics driver might be outdated (see above), or the game is running out of memory. If you computer is within minimal requirements, try to reboot it first. If that doesn't help you can try using launch option: [code]--gfx-safe-mode[\/code]

[h1]Game shows ""loading mods error"" during startup, but no mods are installed[\/h1]
The game probably did not install or update correctly. Open Factorio properties in Steam Library and use ""Verify integrity of game files"" function.

[h1]Game stutters, or is locked to sub-60 framerate[\/h1]
Try to toggle ""Wait for V-sync"" in graphics options. If that doesn't help, try to disable ""Use flip presentation model"" graphics option and restart the game.

[h1]Game randomly crashes saying ""The video card has been physically removed""[\/h1]
This might be graphics driver issue, so you can try to install different version of the driver. It could be also problem with HW. Your power supply might be insufficient, or power cables could be loose, or graphics card could be badly seated in the slot, or something else could be wrong causing GPU to reset itself. Sometime changing ""Use flip presentation model"" graphics option or switching to OpenGL can stop the resets from happening.

[h1]Issues with capturing the game footage[\/h1]
Your capture software might record just black screen. This happens for example in OBS with Window Capture. You should use [b]Game Capture[\/b] instead. If you can't use Game Capture (or equivalent mode in other software), you can try to [b]disable ""Use flip presentation model"" in graphics settings[\/b] and restart the game.

[h1]Gameplay issues that are not bugs[\/h1]
Some issues are reported repeatedly, but they are actually not bugs.
[list][*][b]Island spawn: [\/b]After starting a new game you spawn on a small island and are not able to mine any ores or move to the mainland. This is not a bug as terrain generation works as expected but gives unexpected results. Simply press Escape and click Restart to generate a new map.
[*][b]The well: [\/b]after landfilling over an offshore pump the pump is still working although there is no water next to it. This is not a bug, you merely created a well \/ underground pump.

I thought it could be because I was saving a huge map. So I started a new game, played a couple hours only, saved and got the same message when I closed the game.

I figured that after closing the game I can go in my steam library and try to synch again. Most of the times it works. So I guess it is not the end of the world.

Oh and for info, when I close the game, from desktop I right click the Steam icon, bottom right, and I see Factorio written in blue, with a blue (or is it white?) ring in front of it. Then I synch and that is gone.

I figured that after closing the game I can go in my steam library and try to synch again. Most of the times it works. So I guess it is not the end of the world.

Oh and for info, when I close the game, from desktop I right click the Steam icon, bottom right, and I see Factorio written in blue, with a blue (or is it white?) ring in front of it. Then I synch and that is gone.

I'm dumb with computers, no idea if all that is bad or should be ignored.
Any thoughts? Thanks.","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/4033600533831886985/","18/12/23 19:20","18/01/2024 13:12:13","Bug Report"

Pic #1, you see a train stop on the left, the 2 trains are identical and set to automatic movement.  The train on the left is waiting at the stop, The train on the right is waiting because of a red rail signal.  All is working as expected.

Pic #2, zoomed in between the trains.  I added a copy of the rails and rail signals, north of the ""real track"", so you can see clearly where the signals are. (There is a rail signal hidden by the artillery wagon, that's the point)

Pic #3, maybe half a second before this screenshot was taken, I removed the signal to the right, the one that forced the train on the right to wait.  The result is that the train started moving, as expected.  You can see the smoke on the pic, that train is moving.

Pic #4, that is the end result.  The last wagon from the first train and the first locomotive of the 2nd train are overlapping.  That position is reached without any apparent collision and without any damage being dealt to either train.

I've been going through the demo, playing factorio for the first time.
I had a major issue with the train tutorial

For the last part of the tutorial, you have to repair the base and get the train working.
I eventually managed to fix the train and make it go to the iron mine, then it got stuck there forever with a ""no path"" error.

I could drive the train perfectly fine in manual mode back and forth but it could only go one way in automatic mode. The train refuses to move the other way saying ""path error"". The path is completely fine since I can do it in manual mode.

It took me 2 hours, going through dozens of posts on forums with the same issue and watching 4 train videos on youtube before I could get the train to work.
It's super convoluted and not explained at all.

The tutorial comes with broken train tracks + a locomotive + 2 wagons.

What you need to actually do to get the train working:
1) repair the tracks
2) put signals at each end of the track, on the right side of the track
3) put a second locomotive, rotate the locomotive to face the intended direction
4) fill the second locomotive with coal
5) last but not least, create an automatic route

It would be great if the tutorial could actually go over all these steps!

The issue with fuel is especially vicious because the tutorial comes with a locomotive already setup with a coal inserter.
If you try to add a second locomotive by chance (good guess or first google answer), you have'd to be super lucky that it comes in the right direction AND guess that it needs fuel, otherwise you're gonna be stuck for hours.","en","-","issue: train tutorial cannot be completed ""no path""Hello,

I am playing Factorio for the first time, trying the demo before I buy the game
Forgive me if what I am about to report looks stupid to experienced players, I might be the last person on this planet who didn't play this game before. ^^

The majority of my interactions with the game so far is a stupid error ""cannot reach"".
Whenever I click somewhere, it just doesn't work.
I got that thousands of time since I started playing a few hours ago. 
IT IS INFURIATING!!! The game is just broken to me. 

screenshot:
https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=3065591346

I understand that the character has to be nearby to what you want to interact with, otherwise you could control the whole map. But this can't be intentional?

Playing on a large 32 inch 4k display with some scaling.
See screenshot, I am at a very reasonable level of zoom and 80% of the screen is impossible to click on? This can't be intentional?
I can't build anything, I can't open any of the building to see what they do. (Remember I am playing the game for the first time trying to understand what things are).

In fact I had to give up on using zoom\/unzoom at all. 
If I zoom close to not have the issue, I can't see more than two buildings away, I cannot play.
If I unzoom to be able to see some distance (anything larger than the screenshot), that makes 95% of the screen dead with ""cannot reach"" errors. The game is unplayable. 

Maybe you have a rendering\/scaling issue?
Or if you decided to limit the playable area 10 years ago when you first released the game, maybe you need to make some adjustments now that size and resolution have increased?

I believe the Lab research speed upgrades are not being applied correctly, particularly the level 2 upgrade.  My understanding is that level 1 provides 20% reduction on the timed cycles of each science pack.  Level 2 provides 30% with each subsequent upgrade being cumulative to the existing.  With this in mind my understanding is that research speed level 1 and 2 should provide a 50% reduction to the total cycle time?   [please let me know if I'm misunderstanding the way in which this is calculated]

[B]REPLICATION:[\/B]
With Lab research speed 2 applied, I timed a 30s cycle technology (electric energy distribution 1) with 50% cumulative bonus at ~20s.  Is this not supposed to be 15s?  When timing the first upgrade (20%) I timed a 30s cycle tech at ~25s which still appears off but is a lot closer to my calculation of 24s.  I'm new to this game so I haven't achieved the other upgrades to test further so please excuse my limited data and misunderstanding if any.

[B]ANSWER:[\/B]
I just found this page and the calculations hold up answering my query and revealing that there is no bug but behaving as intended.  For those interested I will post some information and the wiki page link below:

Calculation is [u]not[\/u] a direct percentage of the cycle time for each science pack unit as I was originally thinking but follows the following formula:

T = (T[0] x P) \/ (L x S)

T = total cycle time
T[0] = standard time (in seconds) per cycle (listed on technology)
P = number of science pack units
L = number of labs
S = speed modification provided by research and\/or modules, which is calculated by
(1 + B[r]) x (1 + M[r])

So to plug in my above problem, I have:

1 x Lab
Level 2 Lab research speed researched
No modules installed

Researching Electric energy distribution 1 = 120 automation + logistic science packs @ 30s cycles.  First I need to calculate the speed modifications which I only have research which is giving me 50%.

50 \/ 100 = 0.5

Now plug that into the speed modification formula:   (1 + B[r]) x (1 + M[r])
(1 + 0.5) x (1 + 0) = 1.5

Now plug my speed modification into the main time formula:   T = (T[0] x P) \/ (L x S)
T = (30s x 120) \/ (1 x 1.5)

This formula equals to 2400 which if you divide by ""P"" again will give you your actual cycle time in seconds:

2400 \/ 120 = 20s

Uninstalling and reinstalling the game will not fix the issue as the config file is stored in a hidden folder in the users's OS profile completely outside the game.

The resolution scale UI setting can make the UI so large on low resolution devices that buttons, including the critical ""accept new settings button"" are rendered off screen and there is no way to mouse over to change any additional settings if a user accidentally sets the UI scale too large.

The only fallback at this point is to manually navigate to this hidden file (extra annoying on the Steam Deck but at least it's possible) and either delete the file completely or edit the scale in the file.

Can the UI render code be updated to handle this edge case and allow the settings menu in game to be functional enough to reset this back without needing to resort to external fixes?","en","-","UI scale bug on Steam Deck and other low resolution devices can render game permanently unplayable, requiring manual editing of config.iniI was messing around with Factorio on my Steam Deck to see if it was playable and I encountered a really nasty UI bug that basically renders the game unplayable permanently until a persistent config file is edited.

I have steam installed. However, when i attempt to launch the game demo I get the following error: ""Failed to create OpenGL context: Could not create GL context: GLXBadFBConfig""

So to the interwebs and forums to find a solution...It sounds like i need to upgrade my openGL drivers, but the core profile is already 3.3. And searching for how to upgrade isnt very clear. Any guidance would be appreciated, especially if you have an intel graphics system running factorio on debian.

I came back to Factorio after a while.  From time to time I have this error which crash the game to desktop. I know there's already an old topic about it with a solution but it's not applicable since it address an older driver version than mine.

Never had any crash like this on Factorio before with the very same computer, even with game sessions longer than 72 hours and more than 1k hours played. Never ever saw any error like this on all the games I play (and there're many). GC doing fine in OCCT tests, beeing memory or GPU.

"Factorio","Sandbox","felix","1","the sound doubles when placing an ingredient inside the chemical plant","en","-","i'm making some batteries and only want a few, you only need one iron and copper plate with the sulfuric acid. 

when moving items inside the inventory there is one sound for the shift-click and another when clicking (without shift) to grab a stack or a single item. (i'm describing the two normal-functioning sounds from the clicks inside the inventory).

so when i grab some iron plates from my inventory and with right-click place one inside the chemical plant i hear how the sound (from the click without shift) doubles (sometimes they overlap to sound like the same normal sound but louder and sometimes you can distinguish how there are two sounds). i don't think this is intended, when i heard it it annoyed me (i tried restarting the game but it didn't change). 

to replicate this bug, you need a chemical plant or an assembling machine which needs to be connected to power and with a recipe set. it has to be empty. then when you place an ingredient inside the indicated slot while it is still red (meaning it still needs more of that ingredient to make the product) the bug can be heard.","en","-","the sound doubles when placing an ingredient inside the chemical planti'm making some batteries and only want a few, you only need one iron and copper plate with the sulfuric acid.

i had change my cpu from ir5400 to i5 12400 and the speed is already the same. 
the momory charge is always 32go on 64go possible.
and gpu charge 50% 
normally the graphic card not influence the speed. no ?
i must change the graphic card before a new cpu ? that's will change something
i will take i7 13700k and a gpu 4070.i hopoe that change the speed.

After checking the trace, I found out that 2\/3 of the time is spent processing the TrainPathFinder::findPath function, which is called from RailChainSignal::setup. In this case, the fps drop occurs regardless of whether the new railway segment is connected to the main one or not.

This behavior was not observed on the same version of the game before. I will assume that the problem is related to the total number of entities processed by the findpath function

I am quite aware that large Factorio maps often have trouble sync'ing, but my current map is quite small.  I also have not had any issues in the past even with ""my"" somewhat large maps, and I wasn't having any issues with this one either. 

The problem has been random, sometimes happens and at other times it does not, and when it does happen the problem lasts from a few minutes to a couple hours and then goes away.  Retries during that biggy time period just keep failing, pointing towards a likely server or communication channel issue.

I contacted the developer and they said that they basically do nothing for Steam Cloud syncs, that Steam knows the folder and does everything on its own from that info.

You pull out the repair pack, hover over the object to be repaired, click, and the repair pack just vanishes back into your inventory and nothing is repaired.

This is not how it's supposed to work. Usually, you pull out the pack, hover over the damaged object in close proximity, then left click, hold, and wait until the object is repaired. I did that like a thousand times already, but now it bugs out.

With a little experimentation, I found out: When you put the repair pack into your shortcut slot (1 or 2), then open your inventory, grab the pack, hover over the damaged object while your inventory is still open, holding left mouse button then close the inventory, the object repairs normally (you hear the usual whirling sound from the repair operation). That is the only way to repair an object for me right now.

It's not a mod problem. I deinstalled all mods, started a new standard free mode game, shot an object so it needs repairing, made a repair pack and it has the same bug (only workaround is the shortcut thing I described above).

I have no idea what causes this or how to repair this bug.","en","-","Repair pack bugThere is a bug, when you use the repair pack (or try to anyway).

I've been having an issue with Factorio since I got a new PC in January where my computer will randomly crash while running the game with no warning. The issue is only with Factorio, all the other games i have work fine. The game launches and runs fine till it crashes, and there's nothing consistently happening when it crashes. The crashes are a full computer crash, not just a crash to desktop, and typically it's a freeze, followed by an automatic restart but it has been a Windows blue error screen a couple times. Also I have a pretty powerful computer, so there shouldn't be any issues with running the game. I've tried restarting my computer, verifying the integrity of the files, uninstalling and reinstalling, closing all apps i had running in the background, and adjusting the in game settings. I don't have any mods installed either. Does anyone know any fixes, suggestions or even whats causing the crashes?
Here's the log file: (Also the big time jump in the log file is because I left the game open on the main menu to see if it'd crash before loading a save, after which it crashed)

I never had the game crash before. Lot's of disconnects sure but no crashes. I suspect this is because of the latest update.

It seems to crash on random things but one thing that definitely makes the game crash for me is when I have a stack on my cursor and I drop it into a factory with ctrl+click. I can drop items when I open the factorio inventory and ctrl+click empty space in my inventory.

The logs do not say anyting usefull really except that I quit the game.

Version 1.1.72
Mac mini (2018) no Apple sillicon, just plebby Intel.
Intel UHD Graphics 630 1536 MB
6GB ram which I can double if I stop being lazy.

It doesn't happen every time I tab out but it does happen quite often and is very annoying because I basically have to wait for the game to auto save so I can restart it. The game does not freeze. Everything runs like normal, it just doesn't seem to take any input from my mouse or keyboard. I didn't attach the logs because I checked them myself and didn't notice any sort of warning or error around when the bug occurred but I can still send them if the devs want them.

The last time I played this game was many months ago on Windows 10 so my guess is it might have something to do with Windows 11 but I haven't seen anyone else experiencing this issue so I am unsure.

Game started failing to load after I accidentally reset graphics settings to default after a more normal crash (accidentally ran a second graphics-intensive program at the same time, ran out of video memory). After restarting, was consistently getting a BSOD on loading the game while building sprites, after the parallel sprite loader is initialized according to the logs. Standard igfx page fault crash, so did the tired old update-graphics-drivers-and-reinstall-everything with no success. Moved on to looking at configuration options, tried launching game forcing opengl (same result) and direct3D, which instead crashed 'properly', at the same stage, with an apparently generic error (SymGetLineFromAddr64, error code 487) happening in CreateDirect3D11SurfaceFromDXGISurface. Finally tried enabling verbose logging to see if that revealed any more information, leaving direct3D forced, and the game loaded successfully. At the point in the log where the crash had been happening, there were now a set of warnings about mipmap levels in sprites. Given that verbose logging somehow fixed the issue, my only guess is that somehow there's a logging function that accesses data differently depending on whether or not verbose logging is enabled, and if it isn't it has a risk of causing a page fault or something.","en","-","Odd crash w/ modded game, possibly related to logging?I was able to fix the problem I had, sort of, but the way I was able to fix it is weird enough that I thought I should post about it here.

[\/code]","en","-","Steam API can't intiialize, can't load up old saves After the new update my vanilla install can not open my saves from a few days ago. I have tried closing the game and opening again, verifying install, restarting steam multiple times, logging out of steam and back in. Nothing has worked. All I see when I try to load a game up are old saves from back when I played the demo for some reason:? Don't know what's going on so any help is appreciated.

I have tried closing the game and opening again, verifying install, restarting steam multiple times, logging out of steam and back in. Nothing has worked. All I see when I try to load a game up are old saves from back when I played the demo for some reason:? Don't know what's going on so any help is appreciated.

First time posting here, never had issues with the game in the years iv been playing.

I have an old save with many hours on, and i'm revisiting it at the moment, but once an hour or so, my game crashes. sometimes leading to a blue screen. 

My system has been pretty stable for a while now and the only change is that i started playing Factorio, i feel safe saying Factorio is causing the blue screens too.

My save is completely vanilla.

Here's a copy of the crash report:

First time posting here, never had issues with the game in the years iv been playing.

I have an old save with many hours on, and i'm revisiting it at the moment, but once an hour or so, my game crashes. sometimes leading to a blue screen. 

My system has been pretty stable for a while now and the only change is that i started playing Factorio, i feel safe saying Factorio is causing the blue screens too.

My save is completely vanilla.

Here's a copy of the crash report:

I never noticed it before but if you open the map and hit one of these buttons, you can see how the FPS drops to 58-56. 

But if you press it several times the FPS will drop to 47-48 FPS. (you can see the FPS in the lower left corner).

It only happens with this section, I don't have any other performance problems, neither on ""big"" bases etc. (the video is recorded starting a new game).

So I started using google to the best of my capabilities but couldn't find an answer that worked. 

Today I just had a thought, can I delete the Steam Cloud save data? And so far it looks like it worked.

Here's what I did:

1: Ensured cloud sync was enabled on the Steam app under Steam-Settings- Cloud- tick Enable Steam Cloud synchronisation for applications which support it.
2: Backup your save files in C:\Users\your user name\AppData\Roaming\Factorio\saves\
3: Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\22094142\427520\ and delete the remote folder and remotecache.vdf.
4: Synced the save game data.
5: Put back all the save files.
6: Synced again as I pressed play.

The 427520 folder, according to a google search, is where the cloud data is stored, I'm sorry if I'm wrong there, just following a tutorial I found on the second link when I typed ""steam delete cloud saves"", but afterwards I played for a bit and saved a few times to see if it was working and so far so good.

Decided to post this as I haven't found anyone trying these steps to solve this problem.
Maybe my google skills aren't the best and that would explain it, but like me there might be other people out there with average search skills, so I hope this helps.","en","-","How to solve ""Unable to sync"" save game problem.Hi everyone, even though I didn't play Factorio for a few months suddenly I had an icon next to Factorio saying it couldn't sync my save data back in November, I didn't pay it too much attention as I was playing other games, but now I came back to it and it was just annoying me.

I think ive had a similar problem with ""7 days to die"" too, so maybe steam is the issue? but ive played tons of games on steam without issue...","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3201493200078968111/","05/12/21 19:05","18/01/2024 13:17:40","Bug Report"

I have a problem with the trains and can't find the problem. Have a megabase with 175 trains and 350 stops. I have a circle system, which means the trains can only go in one direction. For a few hours now, the problem has arisen that some trains, for example in my plastic productions, have the message ""Destination not reachable"". However, the trains have a goal that they can achieve. Manuel, I can take the trains to their destination, and I can also let them go to their destination manually. Sometimes the trains simply leave at some point with this message. Unfortunately I don't know why. Could someone help me with this?","en","-","Train dont workHi there,

I turned the settings as low as possible, exited all other apps except Steam, restarted multiple times. It just freezes after an inconsistent amount of time. Nothing makes sense, unless Steam had an update that changed something which could explain the pause during downloading.

About that pause.... it stopped displaying the correct spot on the download bar and bites count after just over halfway. Yet, after some time, it changed as if it was finished. I'm wondering if it wasn't a display error in Steam, but a downloading error where it gave up and said ""I'm done. Deal with it."" I'll try it again and see if the same thing happens.
