PINNED:FAQs,it's happening,60,"Is the game multiplayer?\nThe game supports local co-op and online multiplayer, and works well with remote play tools like Steam's Remote Play Together and Parsec.\nYou can mix and match these, too, so you can do whatever combination works best for your group. You can have two people playing on the same computer, connected with another person running the game on their computer who is sharing it with another friend over Parsec (if you wanted to!)\n\nHow much does it cost?\nThe game will have an SRP of \u00a314.99 \/ $17.99 \/ \u20ac17.99. For other regions we are using Steam\u2019s regional pricing system. Expect the prices to be close to similar prices games\n\nCan I try before I buy?\nYep \u2013 the free Steam demo will remain available.\n\nCan I save mid run? \nYup! If you quit the game or it crashes during the run, the game will save automatically and you can go back into your game by using the floppy disc in your lobby\n\nWhere can I join in with the PlateUp! Community?\nIf you want to keep up-to-date for changes, you should follow the game on Steam and join our Discord[discord.gg\/plateup].\n\nWill you be adding to the game post launch? \nWe\u2019re hoping this is very much the start for PlateUp! If the demand is there, we\u2019ll be ready to serve up additional content.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1599600/discussions/0/3123801577569594952/

PINNED:How to setup Twitch,IsaacYG,0,"[h1]How to setup Twitch[\/h1]\n[b]NOTE: Only the host of the multiplayer game should run the Twitch tool. It will work across multiple channels once the host has set it up correctly.[\/b]\n\n[h1]Launching the Chef Twitch tool[\/h1]\n[list][*]Go into the options\n[*]Go into Additional Options\n[*]Select Open Chef\n[\/list]\n\nUpon launching chef two additional windows may appear. One being Windows Firewall, please give the Chef tool permission. The other being the Twitch authorisation screen on this screen hit Authorize to connect Twitch.\n\n[h1]Authentication[\/h1]\n[url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/t9zeDOW]IMAGE [\/url]\nIf you did not authorize your account with the initial pop up please follow these steps. At the top of the first tab there is a button \""Connect Twitch\"". Once you press this button a webpage will appear instructing you to sign in to Authenticate your account. You will know you account is fully connected if under the Channels section it connects and no longer is showing the spinning circle.\n\n[h1]Streaming with Friends - How to add additional channels[\/h1]\nOnce the host Twitch account is fully connected, simply add the channels name you would like to partake in the integration too using the text box. Be sure to hit Enter after typing the name. You will know the account has been added once the grey circle has stopped spinning and their name is no longer greyed out.\n[url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/sr3iRIz]EXAMPLE[\/url]\n\nBy setting others channels to be included in the commands, it does mean the host will also send messages in each individual chat telling viewers they can use the commands there too.\n\n[h1]Visitors & Ordering Meals[\/h1]\n[url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/uq1JDlx]IMAGE[\/url]\nBy default visiting is set to [b]ON[\/b] and available to [b]ALL[\/b] viewers. This can be changed at any time. Changing between permissions does not clear the current queue.\nThe options are:\n[list]\n[*]Off\n[*]All Viewers\n[*]Subs Only\n[*]VIP Only\n[\/list]\nThese can be set individually for both Visitors & Meals.\nBy allowing visitors the names of the viewers who use the !visit command will appear above the heads of the customer. The !visit command will not be recognised until you begin a game, any commands used whilst the players are in the hub will be ignored. Once a viewer has used !visit they will be in the queue for the entire restaurant run and will not need to use it again until you fail and start a new restaurant.\n\nBy allowing visitors to choose their meal an overlay will appear on the screen which will show the viewers which dishes are available to order. These can be ordered anytime up to before arriving at the restaurant. These commands will appear as !order1, !order2, !order3. There will never be more than 3 available orders. If an order is not chosen a random one will be chosen.\n\n[h1]In-Game Tips[\/h1]\n[url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/vDtXayA]IMAGE[\/url]\n[b]THIS IS SET TO OFF BY DEFAULT[\/b]\nFor Streamers who want to add other ways for viewers to interact with the Stream there is the option to turn on in-game tips. This allows viewers to have their bit donations shown in game as a tip after their meal. This can be a fun way to integrate bits into a stream. There is also the option for viewers who have donated bits to skip the queue, this number can be set as high or as low as the streamer wishes. The default for this is 10 bits. The purpose of viewers who have donated to skip the queue is that their bit tips can be seen in game.\n\nIf multiple channels are connected, donating bits will work across multiple channels and will be shown regardless of which Twitch chat they were donated in. The bits will solely go the to streamer they were donated to.\n\n[b][u]PLATEUP! DOES NOT HANDLE ANY OF THE BITS DONATED AND ONLY READS THE DONATION IN CHAT. NO BITS ARE GIVEN TO THE GAME NOR THE CREATORS OF THE GAME. ALL BIT DONATIONS ARE TREATED LIKE STANDARD BIT DONATIONS[\/u][\/b]\n\n[h1]Card Polls[\/h1]\n[url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/l7DUWgy]IMAGE[\/url]\n[b]To use the integrated polls you are required to be at least an affiliate. [\/b]\nIf this setting is set active it will automatically create a Twitch poll using the Poll system anytime the player gets to a card decision. The poll will appear as two competing bars on the screen, there is an additional option which allows the card decision to be decided by the poll automatically. However with this left off the poll will end and the Streamer still has the final decision. A key thing to note here is that if you decide to use the Twitch polls they will only appear on the hosts stream. [b]If you would like the poll to be across all streams read below. [\/b]\n\nThe duration of the poll can also be set within the Chef tool, the default is 60 seconds however this can be increased\/decreased as the Streamer requires.\nAll standard Twitch Poll systems work as usual, including using channel points\/bits to gain additional votes on a poll. The values of how many bits anc channel points can also be customised in the tool too. \n\n[h1]Text Polls[\/h1]\nIf you are playing with friends and multiple people are streaming at the same time, using text polls are a way to have the same amount of interactivity over multiple streams. When text polls are selected rather than Card Polls, viewers will be able to vote for either card using !a or !b. The visuals for this will be the exact same of the Card Polls except the viewers will be told if they want to vote they have to use chat. All !a or !b commands will be read over all connected channels, so you do not need to worry about one section of viewers missing out!\n\n[h1]Predictions[\/h1]\n[url=https:\/\/imgur.com\/l1Rjmjx]IMAGE[\/url]\nIf you like to use predictions as a way of your viewers using their channel points, there is a quick way to have these trigger from within the tool. This part of the Twitch integration will allow you to create predictions on the fly with a single click, allowing you to focus on the game. You can fully customise the prediction text to match your stream theme or language.\u00a0\nThis prediction will not close automatically so, if for any reason something goes wrong, you will still have the authoritative power of the viewers channel points.\u00a0",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1599600/discussions/0/3464976518707047461/

I don't see any option to purchase or even view the DLC(s) for PlateUp! on Steam. <- Please do not answer if it's from places that Steam doesn't allow promoting.\n2.

I tried the same thing with the 'profile' folder, didn't help either. Verifying integrity didn't help. I created 2 new dummy accounts just to see what happened with the files - deleting every single new progress & profile file related to these new creations did not delete the profiles from the game... I had to go inside the game to remove them from the bed... and my original profile was still gone.\n\nIt was at this point that I realized, even though my profile is gone from the home menu - when I 'created a new one' and went into the home lobby - all my saved restaurants, achievements, and crates on the left hand side are still there... like my progress saved itself somehow even though my profile disappeared.\n\nWhat gives?",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1599600/discussions/0/3951406499785783149/

Bartending update?,The Fattest Blunt,1,"This game already functions as a great little restaurant and even coffee shop sim, and i hope to see it continue to grow in those regards. \n\nBut along the way, why not add one of the more shining knights in food service? as the title suggests i'm talking about the bartender. I feel like it would fit well the recipes knowledge aspects that plateup already tries to push in its gameplay, and add a great way to mix up your runs in a normal run as well, if you so choose.

Research and Enchanting desk,Meldiron,5,"Will it ever be possible to have both at once? As far as I can tell so far, you either play the Halloween maps and you only get the enchanting desk, which does create some pretty great things. But you can't get a normal research desk leaving you without many staple items. Or you play a normal map and you never get the enchanting desk (yet blueprints still show the enchanting icon on them). \n\nIf I am correct, then I don't find the Halloween maps all that fun since it limits you greatly by taking away some key items like grabbers, copy desk, discount desk, etc. Which would mean playing normal maps and not having the cool new Halloween items.\n\nSo I ask, will it ever be made possible to have both? That would allow so much fun experimenting.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1599600/discussions/0/3877095833483288020/

Normal solutions (restarting the connections, switching connections, switching the host etc etc.) didn't work.

So in this game if you know you are losing,angriff,10,"QUIT to Headquarters so that game is saved.  The only way to get ahead in this game and save your progress is to perform a preventative QUIT to headquarters in the game.  Sort of stupid, I know, but seems the only way to save what progress you have and try again the same store with a different tack.  \n\nThis is especially true if you get into the game and decide your layout is not conducive to efficiency.  An example is having put an ingredient in the corner and the game mechanics make all but impossible to select the corner ingredient.  You have to quit to save and the next launch re-arrange before you let customers arrive.\n\nIf you let the game end you day and your game, you will lose all your progress and any saved game to this point.  It is an aspect that I hate, vehemently but unless you do this you cant ever hope to see more of the game.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1599600/discussions/0/5824898961059685299/

More Ways to Serve Customers?,HOAI,2,"Would kill for some other modes of giving people food, like delivery pickup drivers, customers waiting in line for their own food, drive-thru, etc. \n\n-\n[b]Delivery Pickup:[\/b] Bag food, leave on a surface, \""driver\"" comes to pick up and leave automatically.\n[b]Customer Line:[\/b] Customers stand at surface, waiting for food. Orders immediately, food served to directly to customer. May ask for bag to leave instead of eating in.\n[b]Drive-Thru Window:[\/b] Serve food in bag at window on outer edge of restaurant. Lower patience, never seated.\n-\n\nI think it'd add a lot of variety to the game while still allowing for the existing mechanics to play into these new types of serving, and could feasibly be added as level components or blueprint items. Been enjoying the game for a long time, but I think the singular method of serving customers is holding back a lot of potential for player expression with restaurant layouts. \n\nI think a big thing with the game right now is that all customers are expected to come in, sit down, then leave. There's no takeout or customers who pick up their own orders, and being able to combine elements of them together optionally would be really cool. \n\nWe only ever really get to be one type of restaurant and it'd be really nice to see more, especially as we see more and more food (modded or official) that feel better suited to these other real-world variations on food service.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1599600/discussions/0/3814039462157962408/

Grabber bug on coffee shop?,Eren,6,"this used to work fine, but lately it just keeps doing it. Im automating the lattes and have to set up so one smart grabber takes the milk off the grabber while another smart grabber takes the lattes off the grabber and pushes them into a frozen prep station; however, every other time it keeps accepting milk into the latte smart grabber and breaking the automation. is there a way to fix this? It never used to do this and its getting really annoying and i genuinely cant tell if its a bug, a tick error or what\n\nIssue is temporarily fixed by using a rotating grabber and pointing it into nothing. It pulls from the machine but can't send it anywhere, th smart grabbers can then do their thing without the weird bug occurring. Still don't know why its broken or how to fix it without having to do this",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1599600/discussions/0/3801650561768212205/
