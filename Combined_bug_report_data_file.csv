The Neighbor flies,Diavol X,0,I was playing I wanted to burgle the neighbor's house in act 1 but the neighbor took (I didn't know he could do that) the TV so I heard strange sounds and I started seeing the Neighbor flying holding the TV the problem was that the last time that I made him fly away because he kicked an armchair while he was on it and started flying so far that he fell off the map and the game crashed. so he was now under the map and was slowly going down until the game crashed but luckily he had grabbed me first and brought me to the neighbor's nightmare so the game had automatically saved and when it crashed I was back at the same point I entered the house I took the bucket and before he went to where the TV is I took it away from him,https://steamcommunity.com/app/521890/discussions/1/6266251726415120397/,,,,,,,,Hello Neighbour,Bug Report

Hello Neighbor crash when loading the game,DAYVUUN,5,"Think I found the fix to this... Before you boot this game up, ensure that you have the Epic Games Launcher downloaded and updated.  Find Hello Neighbor in your steam library, right click and hit properties, hit local files, then browse. Look for the Engine folder, then find the Extras folder, next go into the Redist folder, then the en-us folder. You will see something called UE4PrereqSetup_x64, double click it and ensure that you also have this downloaded before opening up the game. \n\nAfter ensuring that you have all of that done, type env into your windows search bar and find ~Edit the system environment variables~. Make sure you are in the Advanced tab and at the bottom right you will see Environment Variables, click it. NOW MAKE SURE YOU ARE UNDER System variables and hit New... \n\nFor the Variable name: OPENSSL_ia32cap\nFor the Variable value: ~0x20000000\n\nHit Save and this should fix the problem. If it still isn't working, try running the game at a lower frame rate. Had another game that was crashing on me and this fixed the game as well.

Instead of just knocking me off the vehicle and on the ground, it launched me in the air and i never started falling back down.

I decided to try and move around regardless and after a while i managed to somehow reach 1700m depth before i got yeeted super far away, even past the void and then i got chain stuck in an animation of dying and respawning and instantly dying again...all because of that stupid worm.

Map not loading and won't save either; does it happen in PC too?,DJMisterpeluca,8,I'm playing on the PS4 and there's a point where you have to go 1100m to find the architeture body cache; after realizing that I couldn't go that deep I turned back but eventually I went off-limit (by that I mean getting below the ground of a certain part of the map). I was minutes before saving and this probably messed like 3h of gameplay; since after this happened I couldn't save at all. I tried reloading the map by drowning but the loading screen took forever; so I just decided to turn off the PS4; I couldn't find any information of this bug for PS4 (it was released this month I believe) so it'd be really helpful if you could tell if this has happened to you on PC before and what did you do.,https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/3114781060452215842/,,,,,,,,Subnautica: Below Zero,Bug Report

Could graphics performance be increased?,Sushi_Rocks,10,"I will split up the different topics into different parts to allow better oversight.\n\nPart 1\n\nHey devs!\n\nSo today I decided to start up Subnautica:Below Zero again.\nI've played through the multiple times, including two (successful) runs on hardcore (Love your game and work!), so I tried giving the game a go on creative mode this time to just try to mess around with the game and the functions.\n\nDuring past runs I had different experiences with the framerate\/performance of the game (bought the game in Early Access as soon as possible), but didn't really mind them and just turned down graphics quality if the framerates would drop below 30. \n\nToday I decided to try out various options to run the game with higher framerates (30-60 on 3440x1440 (ultra-wide monitor) and 2560x1440 resolutions while trying to achieve optimal graphical results.\n\nWith the highest texture detail option, FPS were okayish on the lower resolution, but made the FPS drop down to 24 on the higher resolution (which I don't consider playable).\n\nMy hardware is bottlenecked by my graphics card, bc I usually don't play many performance intensive games.\n\nHardware devices:\n1) CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700x (8-core) (not overclocked)\n2) GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti\n3) RAM: 16 GB Patriot Viper Steel DDR4-3200 DIMM CL16\n\nNow while running the game, I discovered that the program maxes out the GPU usage at ~97% all the time (highest texture detail), but makes poor use of the CPU and RAM capacity. The CPU-usage would only be at around 14-17% and the RAM usage would usually be around 2.400-3.200\/16.000.\n\nWouldn't it be possible to increase performance by allowing\/\""telling\"" the program to make more use of available RAM and CPU capacities?\n\nFor example by allowing the GPU to outsource some calculation tasks to the CPU or by loading more (texture) data into the RAM storage to speed up calculations in the CPU and GPU by allowing faster access to informations needed for the calculations?\n\nI was playing Wasteland 3 recently - which also uses the Unity engine - and they had more options regarding RAM and performance (which allowed stable 54-144 FPS in ultrawide-resolution on highest g.options) which makes me hopeful that this is also possible for this game. The game allowed to set a higher limit for RAM usage for example.\n\nNow, I don't understand much about the hardware\/software side of this, but would a performance optimization regarding this be possible?",https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/5501743491371389919/,,,,,,,,Subnautica: Below Zero,Bug Report

Performance issues in Subnautica: Below Zero,johnathonrawlings05,2,"Hi all,\n\nI recently got Subnautica Below Zero and it was running fine, but it started lagging a few days ago and I have tried every remedy on the internet:\n\n1. Updated graphics drivers\n2. Terminated unnecessary background processes\n3. Confirmed file integrity in both Steam and my personal files by deleting and redownloading them\n4. Confirmed that my hardware was not overheating (My graphics card never exceeds 40C because of Fan Control, same with CPU)\n5. Did a malware detection (none detected with Windows Threat Protection)\n6. Changed in-game settings to garbage (still didn't work)\n7. Ran Task Manager during the game to see if processors were having trouble, which they weren't.\n\nAt this point I would rather find a problem than for it to magically fix itself because this has been such a long road. I'm very new to computers and I've had a rough start even with my relatively good computer. This is especially frustrating because I can play Subnautica 1 and other games without any lag, but this one gives me trouble. I will appreciate any and all feedback. \n\nMy hardware and software is as follows, if this helps at all:\nHardware:\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz watercooled\nGPU: GEFORCE GTX 960 dual fan cooled, with HDMI output\nRAM: 16GB divided among 4 sticks of 4GB\nSoftware:\nOS: Windows 10 Pro\nGPU Driver Version: 30.0.14.7212\n\nI apologize if some of this was formatted incorrectly or if I am missing information, I've only started to learn computer stuff about 2 months ago when I got my current one to play video games and study for college on.

I switch off cloud sync. No old savegames, I guess this is thanks to switching off cloud sync.\n\nI start a new survival game after the What the Dock update, save and continue several times. No problem at all.\n\nLast night, I save while standing in my small base (only 1 X base piece with 2 hatches, 1 multiprpose  & 1 scanner room), the seatruck (only base module) parked outside. Both are near the escape pod (near in the sense of only having to swim ten seconds from the pod to the base). The base had been built several game days before.\n\nI play a new game in creative mode, for a few hours. Not sure if this is related.\n\nWhen I restart the survival game today and continue from the last save, I see this:\n- Half my inventory is filled with snowballs. I only picked up snow one time and got rid of the snowball immediately, days before, so all of the snowballs are new. Not all inventory slots are filled.\n- All recipes are listed as known in the Wrench tab.\n- The recipes I KNEW at the point of save are flagged as NEW, although they are definitely NOT new. All the other recipes are NOT flagged, although they ARE new.\n- My base is gone. Gone is also the equipment stored inside and the resources stored in the base, in wall lockers (about 12 wall lockers). Other than those (about) 12 wall lockers in the multipurpose room, there were a standard work desk, a bed, three posters from Delta on the wall, and three chique plantters with nut trees. The connected Scanner Room had nothing in it. The X Compartment at the other end of the multipurpose room had 3 wall lockers and 2 hatches.\n- The truck and the escape pod are still there.\n- Nothing special visible about the area or plants \/ animals where the base was placed.\n\nI did not save again and was warned about the last save being 3 minutes old when I exited, so I guess the crazy save game still exists, if anyone would be interested in looking at it.\n\nAny idea what might have gone wrong, and how I could prevent this in the next game?

I then used \""fixleaks\"" and still draining was not working wierdly on my upper areas, but fine on lower.\n\nUsing \""baseflood 0\"" finally cleared the water, but I have found a leak that is unrepairable via console or repair tool, and only visible internally.\n\nIt is directly opposite the new Dock's console, but does not fill the base up with water, just constantly pours out.\n\nEven wierder, secluding the dock behind breach doors still floods the rest of the base slowly, and its very slow but it does keep going. The leak shows up on the base scanner as well.\n\nhttps:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=2863223602",https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/5875531492213882776/,,,,,,,,Subnautica: Below Zero,Bug Report

PINNED:Encountered progress blocker or softlock? Read here!,THE LAW,0,"Hey folks! \nWhile we're on the hunt for those sneaky blockers and softlocks, striving to patch them up as fast as possible, there's always a chance you might stumble upon one. We've put together a handy guide that could assist you in resolving such issues, so why not give it a read? \n\nIf any progress-blocking\/erasing situation happens to you, please still make a thread about it on the \""Tech Support and Bug Reports\"" forum.\nDescribe the issue you have encountered and attach your save game, located in\n[code]...\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Talos2\\Saved\\SaveGames\\[\/code].\nThe save file is named [i]savedata_0\/1\/2.sav[\/i], depending on which game slot card you are playing on. Please upload it to any file hosting service (e.g. Google Drive) and link in the report.\nThis will help us locate the issue and fix it so that it doesn't happen in the future.\n\nAfter that, here are your options of un-locking or restoring your playthrough:\n\n[h3]If you have encoutered a situation where you think the further progression is not possible, but your save file is intact[\/h3]\n\nUse any of the two following methods of unlocking a \""Load checkpoint\"" menu:\n\n[b]Method 1:[\/b]\n1. Go to the Main Menu\n2. While in main menu, press the following key combination on the Numpad (make sure that Num Lock is in the proper state and no buttons are selected): [b]4 6 4 9 7 9 9 9[\/b], that's 8 keys.\n2*. If you're playing with a gamepad (either on PC or on console), the gamepad combination is as follows: [b]LB RB LB RT LT RT RT RT.[\/b] Also 8 keys, should also be pressed in the main menu.\n3. After doing this, open the Play menu.

Rename the most recently changed backup file between these two to [i]savedata_1.sav[\/i].\n6. Launch the game again, your save should be restored to a slightly outdated backup point.\n7.

So I launch it with win 8 compatibility.\n\nAfter the game launches there's like 20% chance I will get to the main menu (It very often crashes again on epileplsy warning).\n\nIf I manage to get lucky I get to the menu screen, the game often crashes there as well but If I am lucky it will enter this dizzy mode of displaying main menu at a very low stuttery framerate (around 5 fps).\n\nI have to wait in this dizzyness state in the main menu for about a minute or so and then the fps stabilizes at 120. Only then I am allowed to play the game.\n\nHowever the issue does not stop there, when I finally manage to enter the game it is still not working properly.

Controller / Video Issues,azimuth,7,"Just started up and played for a few minutes, and already running into a few issues. I'm streaming to my TV with the Steam Link app and using an XBox One controller.\n\n1. navigating through menu and changing settings isn't possible, because controller buttons don't do what they say. For example using the shoulder buttons to navigate to different menu tabs doesn't work, so there's no way to access those settings.\n\n2. in-game controller layout is a bit odd. For example 'run' has been moved from left trigger (which has been 'run' in every game for as long as I can remember) to the right shoulder button, which is pretty awkward to use. \n\nI'd love an easy way to go back to the \""classic\"" layout from the first game, which I found much more intuitive. Is there any reason why the old layout wouldn't work? Like are there extra controls that just wouldn't fit in the old scheme?\n\nBeyond the layout, controls are a bit clunky in general. Even a small thing like putting puzzles together seems slow and awkward, compared with the original game where everything just worked. Not sure if that's another controller-specific issue?\n\n3. engine is jittery and glitchy, which is giving me some motion sickness. I have a new-ish computer with decent specs - 13700k, 4070ti, 32GB 5600MHz DDR5, installed on NVMe M.2 SSD - so I expected a better experience in the graphics department - is there an optimization patch in the works? \n\nWhat are recommended settings for a faster, smoother performance if that's all I care about?\n\nIt feels like the original engine was more polished compared to UE5.

At different locations, devices with rotating parts may stop rotating. I noticed this on N3 and S2. \n13. All trees with light bark in the Megastructure have the same animation (which starts if you hold your gaze on them) swaying in the wind as the plants in the locations outside. It looks strange and even a little creepy. And, to be honest, it doesn\u2019t look very good on ordinary plants either. It would be great if this animation could be disabled. \n14. In S1-8, the hint for jumping from the cube to the platform in front of the pedestal works crookedly. The orange feet sometimes don\u2019t appear at all, sometimes somewhere on the side, usually on the left - next to the red receiver. And because of this, you have to jump at random. \n15. In S3-5, while the platform is moving, the hero can pass through the bars installed along the edges and fall into the water. If you had a connector in your hands at that moment, you will have to restart the location. \n16. If you put a connector between the power barriers in the \""golden\"" puzzle at E3, then when you try to take it the hero will take extra steps, as if the device was standing too far away. It is unlikely that you will be able to get the connector on the first try. \n17. In Utopia, you can walk along the cornice protruding above the water directly to the second pedestal. \n\u2022\u2022\u2022 \n18. Add the ability to enable the background for the compass. Because small compass symbols are generally hard to see, and especially hard to see when there is a bright picture on the screen. \n\n19. Add a constantly glowing outline around the clone's silhouette. Because the gray silhouette of a clone is sometimes difficult to see, especially among gray walls and at a great distance. \n\n20. Photos of the images on the Sphinx monuments, which 1K takes, are of rather poor quality, and they are not full screen, but at best 1\/8. It was easier for me to take a photo on a tablet and check it with it. And if it were possible to display a photo on the screen so that you don\u2019t have to go into the interface, that would be absolutely wonderful. \n\n21. The opportunity to start the race again with the \u201cspirit\u201d of Prometheus. Sometimes, if you lose sight of it, you can get tired of looking for it.

Looking forward to playing the game, but with half the performance of my pc not being used and still running console fps, it's tough to enjoy the splendor of the environment..",https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/4030220670863094091/,,,,,,,,The Talos Principle 2,Bug Report
Save Sync Issue with Talos 2 after PC Redo,Serpent,0,"Upon redoing my PC, the Steam save game sync restored the incorrect save game, leading me to believe that I had lost all my progress. Fortunately, I discovered a backup save game that was synchronized, which I could rename to restore my current progress in the game. I am unsure whether this is a bug or an error on my end.

Crashes now on Steam Deck with existing or new game,Porco Rosso,3,"On the steam deck (last stable version) Game crashes shortly after selecting existing profile or starting with a new profile.

"Straton disappeared in Drowned Valley without interacting, still missing, no audio log in menu to be found.",Mati,1,"When traveling through the Drowned Valley, I found Straton (the orange guy). In an attempt to interact with him by walking into his sprite, I fell into water and drowned. This happened before I interacted with him. After the reload, I went back but found no Straton there. I tried restarting the game, restarting the level by holding X, going to a different part and coming back to Drowned Valley and none of these worked. I am pretty sure I have not interacted with him as I heard no audio message and no audio log is available in my menu under Research tab.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/4030220670866476816/,,,,,,,,The Talos Principle 2,Bug Report

(Utopia/Dystopia) inverter placed through wall,Void,2,"When doing Utopia 2 and Utopia 3 when you take the anti-gravity column, you can accidentally place the inverter on the other side of the roof (meaning the floor after you are upside down), and I don't think you can retrieve it.

"Japanese Audio-only option, please?",Marius Salax Contusor,0,"I play most games with English text and Japanese voices, both because I really don't care  for a lot of American\/English voices\/voice actors and prefer Japanese for lots of reasons, and because I avoid certain topics that are harmful\/sensitive\/problematic in front of my children (e.g., the innate blasphemy of Elohim and defining humanity as, essentially, those who rebel against God). With the audio and interface bound, I don't want to have to look words up every 10 minutes, and would VERY MUCH prefer the ability to interface with the game using English, and listen to Japanese, just like the 1st game did so well. \n\nTLDR: Joining audio and interface is a terrible decision that forces the user to make one of 2 bad choices.

Bug: South 2: Stowaway + South 1 bug (spiral stair to puzzle),G.S.90s,0,"Spent some tme wandering about, prior to entering, solved area 1, 2, 3. Looked for way to activate green sensor on statue.\n\nAfter entering Stowaway, I tried climbing the ladders, but just as the climbing animation finishes, I am pushed off, somehow. This was the case for both ladders. I restarted from last checkpoint, and that seemed to fix it. Why did this happen? I'm not sure, maybe it's due to long playtime, I've been playing for hours, or perhaps those ladders move slightly somehow.\n\n------------------\nI had solved the level, and tried to move some cubes out, to another level through a distant teleporter. Before I could do so, something happened with one of the cubes. I had placed one cube against the low fence, grabbed another cube, and jumped on top of the cube I had placed. Then, I was going to place the one I held, on the other side of the fence, but instead of doing that, I placed it one the cube I stood on accidentally.\n\nThat caused a weird issue, I could place it, move it, but unable to stand on it, there was no collision on the cube, I could just walk through it. Cube placement worked fine, but there was no colliding for the player. My guess is that the collision hitbox was moved somehow, when I accidentally placed the cube on the one I was standing on.

Motion blur/ghosting - how to completely disable?,OutbackCatgirl (kot),13,"It's  not really possible to show this in a screenshot but *any time* there is motion, I am experiencing a subtle blur effect, most noticeable on foliage, which immediately stops on standing still.

I've tested much older games like HL2 to make sure i'm not just misremembering how motion blur (or a lack of) should look, and that doesn't have this effect, so it's definitely something certain modern games like TP2 have started to have.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/3936769163105970821/,,,,,,,,The Talos Principle 2,Bug Report
