Hello Neighbor,Horror,Hello Neighbor crash when loading the game,DAYVUUN,5,"Think I found the fix to this... Before you boot this game up, ensure that you have the Epic Games Launcher downloaded and updated.  Find Hello Neighbor in your steam library, right click and hit properties, hit local files, then browse. Look for the Engine folder, then find the Extras folder, next go into the Redist folder, then the en-us folder. You will see something called UE4PrereqSetup_x64, double click it and ensure that you also have this downloaded before opening up the game. \n\nAfter ensuring that you have all of that done, type env into your windows search bar and find ~Edit the system environment variables~. Make sure you are in the Advanced tab and at the bottom right you will see Environment Variables, click it. NOW MAKE SURE YOU ARE UNDER System variables and hit New... \n\nFor the Variable name: OPENSSL_ia32cap\nFor the Variable value: ~0x20000000\n\nHit Save and this should fix the problem.

After you grab the steak you feed it to the dog. \n\nI am unable to pick up the steak even though visually it looks like the fire was put out. I've tried reloading my last save, closing the game entirely, rebooting, etc... The steak is bugged and I am unable to pick it up.\n\nI am unable to progress the game further because I cannot finish the piece of this puzzle.

"The Forest","Horror","PINNED:OFFICIAL: ModAPI","Metamoth741","43","Over the past few months the number of ModAPI users, and alongside the number of ModAPI users reporting bugs here, has greatly increased. Following the release of updates, strange, game-breaking bugs that we can't reproduce at all have started being reported, typically in small numbers.\n\nThese have, in many cases, been found to be issues affecting people who are using a non-compatible version of ModAPI released for previous versions of the game. Properly uninstalling ModAPI and The Forest, and then re-installing The Forest has been found to fix these types of issues.\n\nIf you are currently - or have in the past - used ModAPI, before reporting a bug we ask that you first attempt the following steps to ensure that this isn't the result of a ModAPI incompatibility:\n\n1. Disable all ModAPI plugins.\n2. Uninstall ModAPI.\n3. Optional - Back up your save folder. This can be found in (Users>Username>AppData>locallow>SKS) and the folder within that directory can be copied elsewhere on your hard drive for safe keeping.\n4. Uninstall The Forest.\n5. [b]IMPORTANT[\/b] - go to your Steam programs directory (typically Program Files (x86)>Steam>steamapps>common) and completely delete your The Forest folder.\n6. Disable Steam Cloud Sync.\n7. Reinstall The Forest.\n8. Launch via Steam.\n\nFor many game-breaking issues experienced by ModAPI users, this process has been found to fix things entirely. However, in some cases the problems experienced by users will persist. If this is the case for you, please post a new topic on the forums, making sure to follow the steps in the [url=http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/242760\/discussions\/1\/353916184353718731\/]main Bug Report topic.[\/url]","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/242760/discussions/1/353916184352622603/","12/01/2024 09:02:47","bug report"

"The Forest","Horror","Unable to save on multiplayer/ black screen","MK7J","12","I have noticed a huge bug\/disappointment in the recent releases of The Forest.  The bug I am referring to is the inability to save games on multiplayer games.  Apparently this is a common bug as research on google shows.  However, it does not affect everyone's game\/computer.  For an example, I am able to host a game and have a friend join.  The second I try to save the screen goes black and doesn't return.  My friend can save and continue playing the game with no problems. The weird part is, is that he says my character can still move by my controls.  Therefore, my game is not crashing...it is just not showing a display.  Aka the black screen of death.\n\nI can save in single player with no problems, it's just multiplayer.  I've tried windowed\/fullscreen, alt+tabbing in and out, running the game in compatibility, and reinstalling on different drives.  However, when my friend hosts the game and I join he can save, but I still have the same issue. At one point it was NOT like this, I could save with no issues (multi and single player).\n\nAfter 10+updates and patiently waiting I'm ashamed I have given up hope for a fix.  I just hope this issue will be further pursued.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/242760/discussions/1/451851477868267319/","12/01/2024 09:02:54","bug report"

The big problem came after tho, bc we can get our things back in a while, but the thing is that I died with the chainsaw in my inventory and when my things desappeared, the chainsaw didnt respawn. So i can replace all the missing items, even the piolet, but not the chainsaw. I ask to my friends if they could see the chainsaw and they could (they didnt have it in they inventory so they didnt lost it) and they could, so essencially I am the only one with the chainsaw missing and i dont know if there is some way to fix it.

I had hoped the latest update might had fixed it, but it didn't and it still happens everytime I grab the shotgun. Any idea as to why this is happening?

While one person experiences the cutscene the other is dragged into one place to watch it happen. Now once she finished becoming a mutant that's when we should've began battle, however we were both frozen into place, he could only open his map and I could only hit and open my map - so, generally very useless. However we took no damage, became fully hungry and thirsty and continued to take no damage.\n\nAs you can't save anywhere in the lab, we are now having to give it another go all the way from the beginning. Fingers crossed it doesn't happen again, and be careful to anyone else giving this boss a go in multiplayer.\n\n-Ash","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/242760/discussions/1/1473096694449537517/","12/01/2024 09:05:58","bug report"

Animals; like a charging moose, flying birds, running squirrels & rabbits, deer, they all seem to go right thru any player built structures as if they are ghost or clipping. They also often phase thru terrain such as mountain sides cliff faces or hills as if they are again ghost? Not sure if this something Endnight is aware of and is adding later or an oversight?

"The Forest","Horror","Log Building Issues","⛤Niko⛤","2","My friend and I have been loving the building in Sons of The Forest, but have noticed a consistent problem of the game not letting is place logs in certain areas unless either we find a very very tight angle, or just mess around with it until it magically works.\n\nMost recently we've been making a 2 story barn for our wood supply, making use of a trapezoidal roof made by placing logs at a 45 degree angle, connecting to a flat 1 tile roof. The terrain around the barn is mostly flat, but we've been struggling to place one 45 degree angle log for our roof for a good while now. The 45 degree beam extends to the ground from the roof, and we can place all the floor ones fine, but when we get to the roof, there's one specific log that just won't place.\n\nWe'll likely change our design a tad to accompany it, but slanted logs like this can just be weirdly buggy, and sometimes the game just doesn't let you place them.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/242760/discussions/1/3779120753782483417/","12/01/2024 09:09:26","bug report"

"The Forest","Horror","Useful advices in case of performance issues","Sanders","0","This Article is mainly for Intel & NVIDIA users : 

Due to recent performance issues regarding The Forest on one of my PCs, here's some trusworthy tips that will surely help you if you are also experiencing performance-like troubles

A-Ensure your computer is up to date 
  A.a- If your CPU is Intel, consider using ""Intel® Driver & Support Assistant"" downloadable on Intel website --> extremely useful for driver checks -> AVOID other non-official drivers checker

B - Perform a clean GPU driver reinstall doing the following steps : 
1. Download the NVIDIA Cleanup Tool (CleanupTool.exe) from the download link below:
https:\/\/developer.nvidia.com\/cleanup-tool
2. Double-click the executable to launch the tool.
3. Click ACCEPT to accept the End User License Agreement.
4. Click Yes at the confirmation prompt.
The progress dialog appears.
Click OK at the completion dialog to close the dialog.

All NVIDIA software and drivers (including CUDA) have now been removed from the system.
NVIDIA recommends rebooting the system after the tool is finished

5. Select & download the driver corresponding to your GPU and OS here : https:\/\/www.nvidia.com\/download\/index.aspx
6.- Run the downloaded driver
- Select ""Driver with GeForce Experience"".
- SELECT ""Custom (Advanced)"" install option and click Next.
- Put a CHECKMARK in the ""Perform clean install"" option and click Next.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Once it is installed, RESTARTthe computer

C. If this is not helping, perform a clean uninstall of the game from Steam
  NOTE: Steam will keep your game saves , you do NOT need to manually delete %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\SKS\TheForest\ as it shouldn't affect your game performance

D. If not helping, consider uninstalling any software that affects your GPU (GPU Tweak III for instance or anything similar)

E.  For Windows 11 users, consider (for testing purpose) disabling the following  : Windows settings > System > Display > Graphics > Change default Graphic settings > ""Variable framerate""

At this point, you are basically playing using vanilla settings so you should notice improvements
Obviously your CPU, RAM and GPU should NOT reach 100% of usage
If so , your game will run but you will inevitably experience a non-smooth gaming session
Same goes for temperature, keep an eye on these (CPU & GPU) --> ""Hardware Monitor"" is a good and light software allowing you to check that 
MOST components should NEVER reach beyong 90° (even 90° is already a lot)
Also MAKE SURE your PSU is delivering ENOUGH power for your whole computer setup --> for instance : a RTX 3070 requires at least a 600W PSU , otherwise your components might not get the required power and thus get performance-lowered.

F. (bonus) There's a eventually another solution for those NOT being able to reach the game quality\/FPS they SHOULD have
When the game starts it prompts you what screen resolution & graphic you wish to get
--> personnally , it bugged me out as when entering the game, it would try to re-apply my usual custom in-game graphic settings and thus conflict with what was selected in the first prompt window

 ---> to resolve it, it's quite simple : Close the game > Open ""Regedit"" from Windows Search bar and reach ""Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\""    > then DELETE ""SKS"" Folder     (this is where your personal settings and key bindings are , including the prompt menu)

If even after all that you are still facing troubles > just go make your computer checked by a local IT repair shop and explain in details what you have done and the results obtained

hope that helps a few of you guys <3","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/242760/discussions/1/3757726349623599078/","12/01/2024 09:10:08","bug report"

"Phasmophobia","Horror","Controller Support in Menus (Settings AND In-Game menus both)","Lombaxtard","1","(I used DualShock 4 to play)\nIt's not great. Cursor is quite slow, controller prompts in the match settings lobby tend to not appear (d-pad at the sides). On a completely unrelated note, if you crouch while in settings (seemingly only when using a controller) quite often you may never uncrouch unless you change lobbies\/start a map. Using completely stock controls layout I'm able to use microphone with L1 (LB) and R1 (RB) WHILE in journal, which even has prompts for the same keys used to jump through categories (photos, evidence, ghosts, etc.). That means every time I peek into journal during a hunt and try go through evidence I have to only use a slow cursor, otherwise I risk getting my mic being picked up by the ghost for navigating menu the intended way. Default controls also assume you're using Cross (A) to turn on and off handheld electronics and interact with cursed possessions. There's an issue however, it's the same button that is used for confirming an option if you're using text instead of speech recognition (especially now that after recent couple of updates Vosk suddenly stopped recognizing my speech at all without any change in game settings and I'm now Forced to use text recognition), which means that if I activate a Spirit Box using Cross (A) I will instantly select an option for a question to the ghost. It's not a huge deal, but I literally cannot enter Ouija board without asking a question, no matter how fast I depress the button. Also, this means that if I remap dropping items to Circle (B) I will not be able to select whatever option is associated with that button in the menu - I will instantly drop the object.\n\nSo to summarize, there needs to be a clear separation between in-game and in-menus, so that controls don't get mixed up and I don't lose sanity by unintentionally asking something through Ouija board that I didn't care for, and not to bring ghosts to me while in hiding spots by going through journal using actual prompts from developers. This separation would automatically account for custom mappings","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/4035851881541073108/","12/01/2024 09:14:02","bug report"

"Phasmophobia","Horror","Weird behaviour when headgear is picked up simultaneously by two players","tuc","1","I just played a game where me and my buddy both picked up the head gear simultaneously and it caused some very weird behaviour...

1) I was able to toggle his night vision goggles on and vica versa. (Imagine the griefing potential during the hunt ːsteammockingː)

2) After my friend had put his headgear back on van's rack, I was able to control the headgear hanging in the van with my toggle night vision key and it did activate the headgear hanging on the wall (sound effect and goggle movement animations). The nightvision goggles did not have any effect on me or my vision, but I was still able to control the gear which was hanging in the rack and was equipped my no one!

3) I was not able to pick up or equip the headgear which my friend had left on the equipment wall. I was still able to toggle it on and off, but I was not able to equip it.

4) I did not have the view model for the night vision goggles on my screen. I mean, normally there should be pair of goggles on top of the screen indicating that person had equipped the night vision goggles. I guess the game still thought that the goggles were equipped by another player.

I was not able to do more vigorous or systematic testing on how this bug behaves, but the take away is that it is possible to duplicate night vision goggles by taking the same item simultaneously and that way other players can either activate or deactivate other players night vision goggles, if the setup is right.

Screenshot #1, I was able to control one of the headsets, without having it equipped.

"Phasmophobia","Horror","Text Bug","Brin_Fallgard","3","Heyo, I only recently started playing, but I think I found an issue with the text system. \n\nI'm playing without a mic, so I wanted to try out the text system that lets you ask questions to the ghost to check for spirit box evidence. Well, I turned it on, and I couldn't turn it off again. I tried going around the map, asking questions, or just sitting in the truck. I could move, interact with objects, turn my flashlight on and off, and cycle through my inventory, but I couldn't open my journal, or the menu. The only way out of it was to trigger the keypad in the truck and leave. I could turn it off when I was back in the main lobby - though that meant I couldn't report the ghost type, or document any further evidence. \n\nIt's only a minor issue, but if you're like me and don't have a mic, or otherwise can't use one, there's no functioning alternative. I know you don't technically need the spirit box at all, but it's helpful when you have a shy ghost, or can't work out exactly where the ghost room is. At the moment, I end the mission assuming that there is spirit box evidence if I've found nothing else after the first two pieces of evidence. However, sometimes it's simply a matter of missing things like orbs, dots, and fingerprints - if my camera isn't set up in exactly the right position, or there is little in a room for a ghost to interact with that could provide fingerprint evidence.\n\nAs I said, it's not a major bug, but since it's an accessibility feature, I definitely feel it's something that needs fixing.\n\nThanks for reading","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/3812909627184880192/","12/01/2024 09:15:55","bug report"

On top of that, I died and when we got back I didn't even lose any equipment. Side note possible related but might just be coincidence, When another member died the ghost book became invisible to everyone but the person dead. We've also had a situation when someone tried to drop the Tripod and having it disappear and break that specific players inventory so that they can't use or swap items. It also wasn't an option to look at on the monitor either.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/3038228835134200027/","12/01/2024 09:16:26","bug report"

I found out something new and after the ghost hunts, the door won't open and I can't get out!

I step on the salt, but it doesn't match the sound of ghost feet. What this means is that the ghost step on the salt first, and after a long time, I hear the sound of ghost feet. Even the cross runs out quickly like a daemon! Even though there's no daemon..\nBesides, I'm dead, but I'm not dying!

Meaning that unless the person is right besides me, they won't hear me. All they will hear is the radio sound twice (once when I first press and and once when I release).  This does not always happen, I would say it happens maybe 30 to 40% of the time but it is quite a game breaking bug as it prevents me from communicating information to my teammates and in more than 1 instance it prevented me from giving them a key information which resulted in 1 or more of them dying trying to get that info again (not knowing I already had it).\n\nI have seen a few post made about this issue and similar issues but most of them have no replies and seeing as they date from fairly far back, also seems like the devs are either not aware or are ignoring the issue. Does anyone have any permanent or temporary fix for this? I tried looking around but couldn't find any.\n\nHere is what I tried so far:\n\n- Verifying integrity of files (More than once)\n- Uninstalling and reinstalling  (More than once)\n- Using a different mic (Even tho it's clearly not a hardware issue since the sound does come out, just not on the radio)\n- Changing Keybind\n- Made sure all my drivers were up to date (Couldn't be that either but why not)\n\nSadly, I can't think of anything else I could try.\n\nThank you for your time and have a nice day!\n\n~Saintinel","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/4035852798890884692/","12/01/2024 09:16:55","bug report"

"Phasmophobia","Horror","Mic not working at all in-game","ProtoTyp._.","1","[b] Situation: [\/b]
I played one evening and everything was fine. The next day I got kicked out of almost every lobby because I wasn't talking. I was confused and checked in singleplayer. The bar in the audio-settings, displaying the current mic input, never moved a bit. Jumped into a game with the Ouija Board and Spirit Box and tested.

[b] So I tried: [\/b]
[list]
[*] Changing mics (only have one so it didn't do much)
[*] Changing between Push-to-Talk, Voice Recognition and Toggle
[*] Changing between Vosk, Windows, Text and None (Text didn't disappear sometimes when ""closing"" the Ouija Board or the Spirit Box, but that's something else)
[*] Restarting game and PC
[*] Checking if PC receives any mic-input (it does)
[*] Checking mic in other games (works just fine)
[*] ""Repairing"" Phasmophobia via Steam settings (several times)
[*] Checking if Phasmophobia still had permission to use the mic (yes it has)
[*] Changing mic settings in Windows settings
[*] Checking drivers
[\/list]

[b] What happend: [\/b]
[list]
[*] Ouija Board sometimes answered my questions like 30 sec after i asked them. Sometimes it just gave me random answers
[*] One time, when switching from Text to Windows, to Vosk, the Ouija Board apparently understood all the questions, answering to the correct question without delay. However the bar in the audio-settings still showed 0 input. And in the next game nothing was working once again.
[*] The Spirit Box' LED for mic input was glowing as long as i pressed the Local communication button but didn't recognize a question

So It's definitively a bug regarding online play & server disconnects.\n\nIt's worse than just that because the game doesn't let you know that you've been disconnected, allowing you to start and lose all subsequent matches without a single notice. thefore, resulting on a big loss of equipments and money depending on the difficulty played.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/4035852164011525660/","12/01/2024 09:17:47","bug report"
"Phasmophobia","Horror","Game Inconsistence Bug/Glitch","Xakurinha32","0","Ghosts are still inconsistent AF, I got a ghost which I thought it was going to be a Raiju or a Yokai, the ghost passed the yokai test and failed the raiju test; HOWEVER, on the result screen I got 'Thay' instead and the ghost never did a single ghost event, wasn't active enough for a thay and never did a single thay thing even tho I spent zero time on the ghost room it also had Normal Running Speeds.\n\nThere has been several other playthroughs where the same had happened and as well as with other ghost types. RN im only playing nightmare mode, but also when I used to play Professional Mode the game would glitch so hard I'd get ZERO Evidences - even on single player mode.\n\nSo I'm thinking about closing the book on this game until the next update comes out and then I finally might check on things again. \n\nCurrently, It's impossible to play online without friends due to the number of hackers\/cheaters and grieffers running the game. I only get 1 good game without these type of players after trying out 7 online matches.\n\nThe number of players who don't understand the game is too big, the devs should definitively work on a bigger tutorial for new players, it should teach players how to get each of the ghost types as well as teach them what they should or shouldn't not do in order to catch a ghost.\n\nand ofc, the game should reward players for going through every single ghost tutorial by giving them +1 prestige level. With this in the game, it should be harder for cheaters to pass by as new players and trick old players  and at the same time it takes a considerably ammount of effort to get +1 prestige for doing all the ghost tutorials - if this is ever implemented, of course; so this way no players will be risking throwing away an account that has gotten it's +1 prestigee for completing tutorial, because it's an \""uncomfortable\"" punishment. as result, less players are going to cheat or grief.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/4035852164011480538/","12/01/2024 09:17:49","bug report"

Now, I tend to play multiplayer with a small group of friends, and my voice works through both proximity and over the radio, but I cannot get any response on either of the cursed objects. I can get the spirit box to work, so it isn't the equipment items that are broken.\n\nI have seen people mention that this was caused in the April Fool's update, but I have no idea what the issue could be. I used to only have this issue with the Monkey Paw, but now the board also doesn't work. \n\nI've seen several people suggest changing the voice recognition mode to VOSK from Windows or installing \""The English Package\""(?)

I could see with the Wraith just getting really unlucky and having a ghost flicker out a lot more and missing it when it flickers in but the oni specifically is more visible during hunts. I have been told by a friend that it is likely it starting a hunt as it enters or leave D.O.T.s and I have only had it happen with ghosts that have dots. However, the Wraith that was invisible was in a Zero Evidence game so I'm not sure if that would still be the cause.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/4035851529332515902/","12/01/2024 09:18:14","bug report"

"Phasmophobia","Horror","Sanity not dropping in singleplayer?","Sharkbait","0","I've been having this issue occasionally where my sanity will not drop AT ALL while I'm playing single-player. This issue never seems to happen in multiplayer lobbies, however. \n\nI first noticed it when I was playing a game on Sunny Meadows and one of my extra objectives was to get average sanity below 25%. No matter how long I sat in total darkness, I never completed the objective. (I did this again and timed it to see if it was just taking really long, I stepped away from my computer for 10 minutes and still nothing). I figured it may have something to do with a ghost blowing out a candle while you're in the candle's 'safe' range that prevents sanity drop but this continued happening even when I didn't bring any candles with me inside the location. \n\nThis isn't only a visual bug with the objective either. The ghost practically refuses to hunt because my sanity is presumably too high.\n\nThis has happened no matter what map I'm on. I'm beginning to wonder if it may be because of the broken sanity monitor that I typically play with somehow? I will try to get this bug again while I have the sanity monitor to see if that's the case. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/4035850896209650964/","12/01/2024 09:20:46","bug report"

"Phasmophobia","Horror","Hunt Loop/Endless Hunt Bug?","toxicgloom","1","Hey! So, me and my friends have run into the issue one time, guaranteed, and I suspect one of our first hunts was the same bug because it went on for several minutes before I died (only one in the house.)\n\nA hunt was triggered when my friend went into the house to grab a picture of a Monkey's Paw. He was just going to wait it out in a closet, but after about two minutes, we started commenting on how long it was. My friend never left the closet. I had died at this point, and was following the ghost around as it destroyed the house. \n\nIt seemed like it never ended, but, we realized that, occasionally, our surviving friend that was outside, could open the door for a few moments before it slammed shut every time he tried to enter the house.\n\nWe finally decided that the friend in the closet would make a run for it, and he made it to the front door before the door slammed shut again, and he was killed. The hunt ended, then, and our surviving friend was able to drive off.\n\nThe ghost was a yokai, if that helps any.\n\nThe game statistics afterwards said that we had spent 48 minutes on this map, and gone through 23 ghost hunts, leaving me believing that every time a hunt ended, it would be triggered again right away, so it gave the illusion of a never-ending hunt.\n\nI'm not sure, but it was a real bummer on our game night and we stopped playing right after because it was just so annoying.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/739630/discussions/2/4035850502441751304/","12/01/2024 09:21:01","bug report"

We both smudged, broke LOS, turned off flashlights and muttered not a peep, but we both died. I watched his attempt during the hunt and the ghost, after being stunned by the T2 smudge, made a beeline to him and walked THROUGH the bookcase to end his life. This could be a hiding spot bug, we said to ourselves (Jinn btw). Well, just now, I played on 13 Willow with another 4-man matchmaking game. Another Jinn. I started a cursed hunt with the music box and wouldn't you know it, after smudging, breaking LOS, turning my flashlight off, and being verrrry cautious to not press my push-to-talk. I was hiding in the given Living Room hiding spot, but the ghost again, after coming out of its stun, beelines for me and I died.

I used the Monkey's Paw to wish for knowledge, and the ghost immediately spawned on top of me before I could escape.

However, Unity's input manager uses different numerical axis\/button mappings for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Subnautica does not account for this in the Mac build (and possibly also not in the Linux build).\n\nThis matches the erroneous behaviour exactly. [url=https:\/\/wiki.unity3d.com\/index.php\/Xbox360Controller]According to this page[\/url] (scroll down to the table under \""Bindings\""), controller axis numbers for Windows (for the drivers described) are as follows:\n\n- 3 = Triggers\n- 4 = R-stick X\n- 5 = R-stick Y\n- 6 = D-pad X\n\nWhile controller axis numbers for Mac are as follows:\n\n- 3 = R-stick X\n- 4 = R-stick Y\n- 5 = LT\n- 6 = RT\n\nAlso refer to the tables in the comments [url=https:\/\/answers.unity.com\/questions\/1350081\/xbox-one-controller-mapping-solved.html]here[\/url] (again, for the Xbox 360 driver).\n\nIn sum, controller support in the Mac build is improperly configured to use Windows-specific axis\/button numbers in Unity's input manager.\n\nPlease fix this urgently. The Mac version has been unplayable with controllers for a long while, and I believe I have identified the issue.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/1658943116242610940/","12/01/2024 09:27:13","bug report"

"Subnautica","Survival","Regular crashes after some hours on any save file, feeling discouraged, please help","ColbyJames","0","My specs to the best of my knowledge:\nNvidia GTX 1650 Super\nAMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4Ghz\n16gb DDR4\nWindows 10 (not activated, but like does that really matter)\n\nIf anyone knows how to read the playerlog at the bottom to potentially help me understand my issue further, please lmk.\n\nPlease ask for further clarification on ANY part of this but here goes. \nTried to get into this game 2 years ago, got many hours into my first playthrough (explored the aurora, built prawn, yet to venture below 500m so not huge progress but enough). As soon as I loaded the NW mushroom forest it felt like my game started to crash regularly. it did not frequently make crash reports when that would happen, OCCASIONALLY my entire pc would crash during gameplay. Basically I'm a forgetful enough person when it comes to saving that I quit playing for 2 years.\nThis week my partner and I caved and really wanted to play, started a new save file and he's been taking it nice and slow. NO issues so far until today. was running around the safe shallows, kelp forests, and grassy plateus getting resources and adding to the base. not venturing out super far, never loaded the mushroom forest on this save file. I left to get a drink and was sitting perfectly still in my seabase, hadn't loaded a new area in a bit, when I got back I unpaused and my game just crashed in front of my eyes with no error message or anything. lost an hour or 2 of progress. \nWhen I opened the game immediately after, I loaded my hours old save and moved around  in my seabase for 5 minutes max, and my ENTIRE PC CRASHED, no blue screen, just as if someone cut the power.\n\nI have verified the integrity of steam files. I did have discord open when the crash happened, I'm certain I would be smart enough to keep chrome closed, the memory hog. If i play again in the next couple days I'll probably have ONLY Subnautica and NZXT open so I can monitor what's going on. I will say though, I feel like when I had this issue 2 years ago, I definitely tried to play with ONLY subnautica open and it just kept happening\n\nHERE IS MY PLAYER LOG FROM TODAY: https:\/\/pastebin.com\/vYQgxFJ2\nIf you know how to read that or can glean any information from it please let me know.\n\nI really don't want to have to play this game with a 5 minute egg timer constantly going reminding me to save or else.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/4038104598694846807/","12/01/2024 09:27:19","bug report"

The only thing left to do was deactivating the Platform and start the Rocket. Did some other Stuff in the Game because... well... i dont really wanted to leave xD\n\nAnyway... today i launched the Game... and my precious Savefile was nonexistent.\nAs i said, my last time playing was a few Years ago (2020) and i switched to a new PC a while ago.\nDoes someone has an Explanation where my Savefile is? Was there an Update\/Patch in the last few Years that could have caused that? Is this a Steam-cloud Error or do i somehow left my Savefile on my last PC?\nIt will take some time to rebuild everything and witness the late-game wholesome moments again (seeing the little ones growing up for example). *sigh* i build a Sample-Database near my Rocket to catalog all plants, animals and Ressources.... it took so long to build all of this x.x\n\nHelp or atleast an Explanation would be really appreciated.\nWhile waiting for a Response from the helpful Elite-Subnautica Players in this Forum or the Dev..... *sigh* looks like i have to do a new Savefile.\n(i have the annoying mental issue, that i refuse to watch\/play a Sequel before i finished the current one - silly, i know.

"Subnautica","Survival","Scanner room does not show ""Fragment"" in the scan list","merusalem","6","Observed: Sometimes the scanner room's resource list does not show ""Fragment"", although it shows all (I think) other resources that are close to the room, including ""Databox"" and ""Wreck"". Even after tearing down the base and rebuilding it near the old location, the new scanner room also does not offer the option to scan for Fragments, although fragments are near.
Tested: I built a scanner room in the mushroon forest, to scan for fragments. I made sure to position the scanner room only about 101 m from the two fragments I had found by accident. These fragments were only a few meters from each other. Whatever I did, I could not get the scan list of the scanner room to show the ""Fragment"" option. I saved, exited the game completely, restarted it and reloaded the last save. I exited and re-entered the base. I swam to the closeby fragments, and swam back to the scanner room. I started scanning the fragments with my hand scanner and stopped before the scanner identified the fragment and destroyed it. I broke down all rooms and accessories of the base and built it up again, only about 20 m from the fragments. I shut down my PC and restarted. I scanned the fragments with my hand scanner and got Titanium for scanning, as I had already gotten both blueprints earlier (cyclops bridge and hull if I remember right). None of this caused the ""Fragmnent"" option to apüpear in the scanner room's list.
Speculation about cause: It could be that fragments change their state once the associated blueprint is discoved, and are no longer recognized as fragments. I have not tested this yet.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/3046104336673885863/","12/01/2024 09:27:51","bug report"

Anybody else have this problem or know a fix? It's not the end of the world i'll just use mouse for now, but i figured the game is on next gen consoles already and it even has options for specific controller layouts so i could just plug and play.

Точный временной промежуток, когда это всё произошло сказать сложно. 
Вчера вечером. Постараюсь по существу:

Вчера произошёл БАГ с сейвом.
Довольно таки уже приличная база построена. Большинство было собрано, кроме ""Циклопа"". Даже уже его собрал.
(инструмент и т.д.).

А заключается БАГ в - ""пропаже анимации движения взаимодействия с предметами"", таких как:

люки, переборки, лестницы.

Анимация просто исчезла. 

Вместо того, что бы открыть люк самому рукой, он открывается сам за секунду, так же и с переборками. И спуском с лестниц, самодельных.
+ к этому, в некоторых местах, пропадают балки (опоры) базы.

Много всего перепробовал, уже не знаю, что делать. Ждать патч наверно новый.

Но, может у кого-нибудь был схожий трабл, и он его решил ?

Подскажите пожалуйста, если есть способ решения, как таковой.
Очень хочется нормально поиграть. А этот баг раздражает.

P.S. Был ещё один.
Выкинуло с базы в воду, при подходе к укреплённой части базы.
В результате чего, персонаж лишился возможности передвигаться в воде в плавь. 
И приобрёл возможность гулять по дну пёхом.

(Но это было только один раз).","ru","The exact time period when it all happened is hard to say. Last night, I'll try to essentially: yesterday BAG and the Savi. A pretty good base has been built. Most have been assembled except for ""Cyclops."" Even already collected it. (Instruction, etc.) And BAG is going to ""drop through the animation of the interaction with objects,"" such as: hatches, bulkheads, stairs. Animation has just disappeared. Instead of opening the hatch itself, it opens itself in seconds, as well as the bulkheads. And it's going down the stairs, the homemade ones. + to this point, in some places, the beams (opuras) bases are missing. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what to do.

I was trying to get my PRAWN Suit up to the Moonpool on the Alien Quarantine Platform so I could use the Portal there to get to the Thermal Facility to get some items I left in the Inactive Lava Zone after I had to leave when my Cyclops was low on power, when suddenly I started to notice that the jump jets were a bit off. Exited the suit to see about figuring out what was going on and found out that my character and the suit itself now thinks that they are on land. No O2 loss or swimming around. Fish and everything else still appear to think they are underwater but the Suit and my Character just simply walking around like they are on land. \n\nHence, I went to look for an option and tried a couple of things. First tried to save, quit the game and then come back. Nope same thing was going on. Then tried to kill my character to reload back in at my base. Thank you nearby Reaper Leviathan for being there and me needing my Brown Pants. Water and swimming works fine till I enter my PRAWN Suit once more and then once again everything seems to be on solid ground again. I then tried to fiddle with the F3 settings for Water and everything. Nope, nothing works there, both in and out of the PRAWN Suit. Nothing else worked, even the Unstuck Option on the Menu, it drags my character out of the Suit and now I am back in the water, but again, once I enter the Suit everything seems to back on Land. \n\nI really do not know what in the world is going on! Help! Do I need to create a new PRAWN Suit or something like that to fix things? Or is it something else? And no, I didn't even get to the Quarantine Platform yet, or any other Alien base. I just was jump jetting towards the Mountain Island like I have done a few times now when it just suddenly became weird.

"Subnautica","Survival","[Possible Spoilers] The Primary Containment Facility is all kinds of broken right now...","LU-C4","5","Once I got to that point in the game, it became pretty much unplayably buggy. Here's a list of everything that went weird:\n\n\nFirst issue is that creatures tend to go through the floor. For example, I've encountered a lava lizard in clipping through the floor of the antechamber. \n\nModel lighting is also messed up. The PDA will glow pink, because the game still treats it as the active lava zone. Even after going through the teleporter to the crag field cache and entered the biome fully, the character model was still glowing as though it were in the lava zone.\n\nThe Prawn Suit tends to get half-stuck in the floor, causing it to only slide around on the floor slowly. Using the jet jump won't get you even a millimeter off the ground when that happens. Even when using the grappling hook, it rarely gets you unstuck. The only temporary fix is going back into the aquarium somehow. No, I did not manage to get my Prawn Suit out of the floor. Yes, I saved after entering the facility with the Prawn Suit.\n\nThe aquarium has several issues. A lot of the time, mostly when getting close to walls, the game will think you're in the active lava zone instead of the aquarium. This usually comes with the entire structure of the aquarium disappearing. I don't even know what triggers it to re-appear (swimming back and forth to- and away from the wall over and over seems to do it), but even when it eventually does, the lighting is completely changed to a black\/green-ish tone. \n\n\nIn conclusion: The Primary Research Facility is an utter glitchfest right now and I couldn't complete the game.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/5879990700811978476/","12/01/2024 09:31:22","bug report"

"Subnautica","Survival","The prawn suit bug! list of bug for the prawn suit.","𝓑𝓘𝓛𝓐𝓣𝓐𝓝-","6","Well this is all the bug I found today. (2017-06-24)

1. The prawn suit movement are unstable for some players.
Sometime the suit can do a 380° when you move the mouse 0.0000000000000001 CM. XD
But yeas the prawn can be a pain to use when it does that.

2. the prawn can make you spawn out of the map.
exit it and byebye world. and yea I know if you stand next to a wall it does spawn sometime out of bounds. but no this bug is 10 time worst. you telepor out of the map in a black space and die from fall damage or the game crash.

3. out of bounds. you exit the prawn or any base, door, cyclop, you know the story...
and you or out of bounds.

4. flying to space. rare but possible. I have no idea of what happen but enter the prawn and space... yeas I can't find a way to do it again. :(

5. death prawn V.1. exit the prawn and die for no reason. random bug.

6. no jetpack. random bug

7. the prawn suit is 100 time heavier.
When you enter the Primary Containment Facility. the prawn suit have a chance to bug alot.
stop- falling. jetpack doesn't work. well it work but the prawn suit just don't go up. it stand on the ground and it affect the grappling arm to. the grappling arm will drag you but you won't go up. the only thing the praawn will do is going down faster and faster and faster until it stand here unable to move.

8. the prawn like to blow up. random. try to get your prawn to blow up and save your game at the same time. when you load your game again it have a chance to be in one piece. but yeas it will explode when you try to use it. bonus it can make other prawn blow up. the game is confuse and just blow up prawn... XD

9. super infine grappling arm. the grappling arm will never let go! never! try to reload your game or delete it because it won't give up. :( random.

10.upgrade doesn't work. random. you can fix it by simply removing the upgrade and placing it again.

death prawn V.2. jumps on your base and watch it blow up. work with the cyclop. jump on it and it blow up! work on you. you die for no reason but your prawn blow up to. bonus this bug happen when you jump on stuff. unlike the death prawn V.1. which just kill you without blowing up or jumping.

Please tell me if you have other bug with the prawn suit. those are game crashing bug. so don't try them. random gonna be a pain. :(","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/2592234299535447489/","12/01/2024 09:34:26","bug report"

the first time i chalked it up to me trying to move around and copy my save files to my laptop so i could play at work. the second time i am playing with a mod that allows me to have achievements even with console commands (as well as a few other mod helper folders in the plugins folder [the correct plugins folder not the wrong one]), as well as used a handful of console commands to get me back to the same place i was when my first save corrupted. i got back to my place, saved the game, (it almost crashed while i tried to save) come back, and its reverted. 
please help? is my pc doing something? is it because i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with it too much and need to just play it regularly again and just manually get back to where i was? i may just wait a few years to play then when  i have a better pc anyway.\/..

"Subnautica","Survival","FIX for Can't Swim Issue (without cheating!)","moray46692","6","Many players have found themselves suddenly unable to swim after visiting the Precursor gun. You exit a base or craft – and fall straight to the ocean floor, unable to swim. The Prawn Suit too behaves as if it were in air, not water. 

If you go to the F1 menu, you see something like this:
LD biome: seaTreaderPath
Player Biome: PrecursorGun
Rich Presence:PresenceExploring_biome_precursorgun

What can you do? ""Unstuck"" from the Pause menu can fix this [i]temporarily[\/i], but it soon reoccurs. You need to reset they player's biome, [i]including for the Prawn Suit[\/i] (and perhaps Sea Moth). It really helps if you can reach your Cyclops. Fortunately mine wasn't too far away, and by building base foundations (even unfinished ones) I could jump my Prawn Suit up to reach the Cyclops docking bay. I took the Cyclops back to the Precursor gun and entered its moonpool. Jumping the Cyclops out of the water helped reset the biome:

LD biome: Precursor_Gun_MoonPoolWatet
Player biome: Precursor_Gun_MoonPoolWater
Rich Presence:Exploring Precursor Installation

That's player's biome resynchronised. Taking the Cyclops down near the moonpool floor (just in case) I launched the Prawn Suit and verified its biome was also reset and it could jump properly through the water. I re-docked it to the Cyclops and exited the gun installation. After that the biome behaviour stayed synchronised: I was able to get back to what I was doing both swimming and in the Prawn Suit.

LD biome: seaTreaderPath
Player biome: seaTreaderPath
Rich Presence:Exploring The Sea Treader Path

I hope that helps others stuck in this issue!","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/6861841362667337140/","12/01/2024 09:35:07","bug report"

"Subnautica","Survival","Story is not progressing: no more radio messages! :(","EllendigeTullip Jägermeister","38","Hi there lovely Subnautica nerds!\n\nSo, as the title suggests, i'm having a big irritating issue at the moment with the game. And before you even start replying, allow me to explain the situation. It's more complicated than you might think...\n\nAlright, at the moment i'm not getting ANY radio messages at all. \nSo i tried to keep playing without getting them, in the hope that in the future, i will get them...Eventually. Hours upon hours of playing have passed and i even got my Prawn Suit and Cyclops...And even now - no radio messages.\n\nI tried something else out which was posted on the Subnautica Steam threads and Reddit: try and find every single PDA of the (destroyed) Lifepods. And i did exactly that. To be honest, i did find 1 PDA that for some strange reason i forgot and thus not picked it up. It was the Aurora Rendezvous PDA. After picking that one up however and listening to it, i STILL did not get any radio message...\nSo now, another 1 hour has passed and still no radio messages. \n\nAccording to Reddit, Steam, YouTube and more there are AT LEAST 2 other places i can explore. Lifepod 2 and the Proposed Degasi Habitat. Both i did not get any radio message of it at all. So wtf am i doing wrong?!\n\nTo provide more information that may help you guys answering, these are the lifepods that i already searched AND got radio messages from:\nLifepod 12 (Medical Officer Danby's Crew Log)\nLifepod 13 (Emmisary's Voicelog)\nLifepod 17 (Crewlog)\nLifepod 19 (Second Officer Keen's Crewlog)\nLifepod 19 (Second Officer Keen's Voicelog)\nLifepod 3 (Crewlog)\nLifepod 4 (Crewlog)\nLifepod 6 (Crewlog #1)\nLifepod 6 (Crewlog #2)\nLifepod 7 (Crewlog)\nRendezvous Voicelog\n\nSo i'm at least missing Lifepod 2 an the Proposed Degasi Habitat. In case somebody would say the story is not progressing further or i already had all thew Lifepods and PDA's,","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/1693788384131544432/","12/01/2024 09:35:50","bug report"

"Subnautica","Survival","!СРОЧНО! Баг при строительстве, как исправлять?","avk.gacc","2","Расширял я, значит, базу... Решил пристроить башню из многофункциональных (круглых) комнат. Схема такая - в башне 3 этажа: 

1 этаж - вход в виде приваренного коридора,
лестница с первого этажа на второй, назовём её лестницей А.
2 этаж - верхнее отверстие лестницы А, и лестница Б : с второго этажа на третий.
3 этаж - верхнее отверстие лестницы Б.

Сама ситуация: зашёл в башню на 1-ом этаже, построил лестницу А, забрался по ней на 2-ой этаж, НАЧАЛ строить лестницу Б, буквально на один процент. А потом спустился   
1-ый этаж и разобрал лестницу А.
И ТУТ ВСЕ СЛОМАЛОСЬ.
Я больше не смог поставить лестницу А. Я не смог поставить НИКАКУЮ лестницу. Я не смог поставить люк. Я не могу НИКАК взаимодействовать с 2-ым и 3-им этажом, даже разобрать их.
При этом я могу взаимодействовать с остальной базой, например, разобрать и установить снова 1-ый этаж. По сути, 2-ой и 3-й этажа башни превратились в обособленный кусок базы, баганутый артефакт, с которым никак нельзя взаимодействовать. 
...и где-то там, внутри, торчит лестница Б собранная на 1%, и связывающая два этажа в единое целое... думаю из-за неё всё и сломалось.

Итак, если вы что-то поняли из невнятных описаний выше, то прошу дать совета - может знаете как это исправлять? Желательно без консоли и читов,
хотя баг тяжёлый и если надо - пойду и на такое.
Если нужна дополнительная информация - прошу в коменты, поспособствую чем смогу.

"Subnautica","Survival","Extensive list of glitches, bugs and annoyances on 1.0","Wisp","13","I posted this on Reddit and on Official forums, and will paste here for more visibility. I won't keep this version updated, only [url=https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/subnautica\/comments\/7wool5\/extensive_list_of_glitches_bugs_and_annoyances_on\/]Reddit[\/url] (Official forums allow only 24h edits)\n\nI will try to keep it simple. [b]Number 1 and 2 are highest priority fixes please[\/b]. Number 11 and even more 32 could possibly help a lot with performance (limit how far bases are seen\/calculated)\n\n1. Texture Quality locked at \""4\"" (highest), causing stutter and eventual break down of the engine with time on anything but ultimate PC-specs. (extra: no Texture Quality slider on options, you have to reduce manually every time you start on F3)\n\n2. Falling through the ground, specially with the PRAWN. Multiple causes but the above can help compound to the problem (collision detection is known to fail on low FPS\/stutter events). Include here multiple clip issues like getting stuck inside walls and such.\n\n3. You cannot access the PRAWN upgrades nor storage while docked at the Moonpool\n\n4. No hitbox on PRAWN (and Seamoth? don't remember) while docked at the Moonpool, so if you get too close\/move over it, you fall\n\n5. Creatures also clipping through terrain and often getting stuck under the floor (happens a lot with reaper leviathans), at which case they are often despawned.\n\n6. Some visual elements like smoke and green\/blue acid pools in the Lost River render in front of the Cyclops bridge overlay, totally hiding them.\n\n7. Neptune Plataform requires \""deep water\"" to be built ... except it is a barge, not a sub.\n\n8. The whole energy transmission issue, where on load they can break chain.\n\n9. Creatures (and cameras!) can move across the water\/air shields on caves, meaning you can be hunted down by hostile creatures into it, or fly with cameras inside.\n\n10. Creating more than one scanner room at a time can cause cameras to have the same number\/name, complicating choosing which to control. \n\n11. Base energy warning is shown no matter how far you are, meaning a random base that have the energy toggling on\/off will keep displaying such message to you forever, causing delay on real time messages. Fix: do not show those messages unless you are close to base.\n\n12. Single fishes enter and get stuck at bases (fix: do not allow them to swim too close to bases). Sometimes even aggressive creatures get inside.\n\n13. School of fishes move inside bases (fix: do not spawn them close to bases)\n\n14. Fishes inside Alien Containment sometimes will also clip out and swim inside your base\n\n15. When you are grabbed by a reaper and thrown away, you can easily clip the ground\/walls. It can also happen when you are pushed by Ghost leviathans. \n\n16. Large bases (not even that large) get annoyingly slow to build with sometimes requiring up to 10 seconds of the game hanging when you add\/remove a module (calculating integrity? seems too much for that)\n\n17. Render distance could be increased on high-end PCs (currently you can tweak clipmaps-high.json to get some more)\n\n18. We need an auto-save, even if the proposed \""when entering\/leaving a base or cyclops\"" because the crashes are causing people to loose hours of gameplay. (extra: improve saving algorithm, takes too long. 100mb savefile? Minecraft autosaves each 10 seconds and can have maps nearly 1Gb)\n\n19. Last 2 achievements not working\n\n20. Deconstructing a moonpool while you are standing on it (possible if you enter it while it is still not fully constructed) causes you to fall with normal gravity to your death\n\n21. Rotating items (like the aurora model) advances to the next item on hotlist, making rotating such items a shore\n\n22. Beacons on dry land have weird glitches, like eventually sliding under the ground\n\n23. If you try to access a locker from a distance, sometimes the PDA won't display\n\n24. If you build your base close to an area where Stalkers play with wreckage, with time there will be literally dozens of stalker tooth on the ocean floor lagging the game (My 28h game, I had to make 3 trips to clean up all the tooth and throw them in the trash)\n\n25. Lifepod icon will stay stuck onscreen (won't move) if you load a save where you hid such icon in the PDA\n\n26. Multiple reports of the giant Tree Cove Tree not showing (happened to me once, I was able to move thru where it should be with my Cyclops with no issues). Reloading fixed it.\n\n27. Cyclops is not flooding\n\n28. Vines clip through everything\n\n29. Teleport\/warp console commands don't work if you are inside a vehicle and often lead you to get stuck.\n\n30. Sometimes the Sunbeam doesn't appear during the descent cutscene.\n\n31. Posters put on a glass window cannot be removed, nor the window.\n\n32. Bases are always visible\/calculated no matter the distance. Other than a visual nuisance (you can see the lights across any distance), it bogs down FPS even when you are far. Same happens with the Cyclops and even sunk Cyclops.\n\n33. Alien Containment hatches are counted towards your base integrity\n\nDISCLAMER: The intention of this post is to help list most bugs in one thread, not to bash the developers. Post anything I missed and I will add to this main text.\n\n* [url=https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/subnautica\/comments\/7wool5\/extensive_list_of_glitches_bugs_and_annoyances_on\/]Main version on reddit[\/url]\n* [url=https:\/\/forums.unknownworlds.com\/discussion\/154108\/extensive-list-of-glitches-bugs-and-annoyances-on-1-0\/p1?new=1]Mirror on official forums[\/url]\n\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/3820783808428478719/","12/01/2024 09:36:01","bug report"

"Subnautica","Survival","Habitat Builder not working","UnholyPens","8","In my experience so far, Subnautica has been great. Very few hiccups, few bugs, and plenty of atmospheric horror. \n\nHowever, when I tried making a bas,e the habitat builder simply refused to respond to any input. It'll pull up the menu to build, as usual, but any time I click on any menu icon, or try and build something, the menu disappears, even if I have enough materials for the selected habitat item. It's really frustrating, because it restricts my ability to make some essential progression. \n\nIf someone knows a solution for this problem, I'd be super grateful.

"Subnautica","Survival","Subnautica Save Bug: Freezing and Crashing with RAM Drain","DeRusGAMING","1","Hey everyone, I've been playing Subnautica for about 15 hours now and I'm loving it, but I've been running into a frustrating issue. When I try to save my game, it freezes and starts eating up my RAM. Eventually, my computer crashes and I have to start over from my last save. I thought it might be related to how far I had traveled in the game, but now it seems completely random. Also, it might be helpful to note that I can often tell when this bug is present before I save because of the lack of props and mobs spawning. This includes fragments, small plants, and even kelps.\n\nIssue: I've been searching online and haven't been able to find anyone else having this problem, which makes me wonder if it's something specific to my computer. My hardware configuration includes an AMD Ryzen 5600H processor, 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD with 80GB of free space, and an Nvidia RTX3060 mobile graphics card. It's really starting to get on my nerves because it's preventing me from making any real progress in the game.\n\nInvestigation: I've tried everything I can think of to fix this issue. I've reinstalled the game, uninstalled any recently installed programs, turned off my antivirus, lowered the game details, and deleted the Cells cache. I even checked the troubleshooting guide, but nothing seems to work.\n\nPossible Solutions: At this point, I'm not sure what else to do. I hope I'll be able to find a solution soon.

That means you can see floating entities, stuff that isn't supposed to be there or in a wrong location.

Can you retouch the map on glider so it shows only your heading (or a 270 degree view), and not the whole surrounding area? It's pretty inconvenient to use the glider map in caves.

the point which shows where i am sometimes becomes almost invisible so I start doing deep-see ballet to find my way around.

I tried reloading the map by drowning but the loading screen took forever; so I just decided to turn off the PS4; I couldn't find any information of this bug for PS4 (it was released this month I believe) so it'd be really helpful if you could tell if this has happened to you on PC before and what did you do.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/3114781060452215842/","12/01/2024 09:38:55","bug report"

I then realized my prawn suit had dissapeared, so I loaded a save from before I transferred so I could save my prawn suit.

And me having a peanut for a brain then saved again after clicking and it doing nothing, and now I don't even have the option to transfer.

"Subnautica: Below Zero","Survival","Prawn Modules Dissapearing","jkal78p","13","So I decided a few minutes ago to get a depth module upgrade for my prawn but I needed some rubies so I hopped in the thing and realized that both my drill arm AND my grappling arm had dissapeared. I went through all my storage bins in my base and on the prawn and on my seatruck and they were just gone. I then checked in my prawn upgrade module thing and realized that not only had every upgrade dissapeared, but so had THE ENTIRE UPGRADE INTERFACE. Now there's just a blank screen where the upgrades used to be, and every single upgrade I once had gained (in a legitamate way, too, no console abuse or anything) had dissapeared. I would like to complete the game, and to do that, I kinda need my prawn and all it's upgrades (I only had the two arms and the boost upgrade thing). So I pressed F3 to allow me to use console, but the button for console had also dissapeared. I'm not sure if the lack of console was a choice on the devs' part or if it is also a bug, but I KNOW that my broken prawn is a bug. Could somebody help me?

"Subnautica: Below Zero","Survival","Could graphics performance be increased?","Sushi_Rocks","10","I will split up the different topics into different parts to allow better oversight.\n\nPart 1\n\nHey devs!\n\nSo today I decided to start up Subnautica:Below Zero again.\nI've played through the multiple times, including two (successful) runs on hardcore (Love your game and work!), so I tried giving the game a go on creative mode this time to just try to mess around with the game and the functions.\n\nDuring past runs I had different experiences with the framerate\/performance of the game (bought the game in Early Access as soon as possible), but didn't really mind them and just turned down graphics quality if the framerates would drop below 30. \n\nToday I decided to try out various options to run the game with higher framerates (30-60 on 3440x1440 (ultra-wide monitor) and 2560x1440 resolutions while trying to achieve optimal graphical results.\n\nWith the highest texture detail option, FPS were okayish on the lower resolution, but made the FPS drop down to 24 on the higher resolution (which I don't consider playable).\n\nMy hardware is bottlenecked by my graphics card, bc I usually don't play many performance intensive games.\n\nHardware devices:\n1) CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700x (8-core) (not overclocked)\n2) GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti\n3) RAM: 16 GB Patriot Viper Steel DDR4-3200 DIMM CL16\n\nNow while running the game, I discovered that the program maxes out the GPU usage at ~97% all the time (highest texture detail), but makes poor use of the CPU and RAM capacity. The CPU-usage would only be at around 14-17% and the RAM usage would usually be around 2.400-3.200\/16.000.\n\nWouldn't it be possible to increase performance by allowing\/\""telling\"" the program to make more use of available RAM and CPU capacities?\n\nFor example by allowing the GPU to outsource some calculation tasks to the CPU or by loading more (texture) data into the RAM storage to speed up calculations in the CPU and GPU by allowing faster access to informations needed for the calculations?\n\nI was playing Wasteland 3 recently - which also uses the Unity engine - and they had more options regarding RAM and performance (which allowed stable 54-144 FPS in ultrawide-resolution on highest g.options) which makes me hopeful that this is also possible for this game. The game allowed to set a higher limit for RAM usage for example.\n\nNow, I don't understand much about the hardware\/software side of this, but would a performance optimization regarding this be possible?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/5501743491371389919/","12/01/2024 09:41:11","bug report"

"Subnautica: Below Zero","Survival","Performance issues in Subnautica: Below Zero","johnathonrawlings05","2","Hi all,\n\nI recently got Subnautica Below Zero and it was running fine, but it started lagging a few days ago and I have tried every remedy on the internet:\n\n1. Updated graphics drivers\n2. Terminated unnecessary background processes\n3. Confirmed file integrity in both Steam and my personal files by deleting and redownloading them\n4. Confirmed that my hardware was not overheating (My graphics card never exceeds 40C because of Fan Control, same with CPU)\n5. Did a malware detection (none detected with Windows Threat Protection)\n6. Changed in-game settings to garbage (still didn't work)\n7. Ran Task Manager during the game to see if processors were having trouble, which they weren't.\n\nAt this point I would rather find a problem than for it to magically fix itself because this has been such a long road. I'm very new to computers and I've had a rough start even with my relatively good computer. This is especially frustrating because I can play Subnautica 1 and other games without any lag, but this one gives me trouble. I will appreciate any and all feedback. \n\nMy hardware and software is as follows, if this helps at all:\nHardware:\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz watercooled\nGPU: GEFORCE GTX 960 dual fan cooled, with HDMI output\nRAM: 16GB divided among 4 sticks of 4GB\nSoftware:\nOS: Windows 10 Pro\nGPU Driver Version: 30.0.14.7212\n\nI apologize if some of this was formatted incorrectly or if I am missing information, I've only started to learn computer stuff about 2 months ago when I got my current one to play video games and study for college on. If anyone can give me information, I would greatly appreciate it because I want to play this game so badly after finishing the first game.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/3765608282419490172/","12/01/2024 09:41:14","bug report"

"Subnautica: Below Zero","Survival","Subnautica Below Zero savegame went crazy with the saved status","merusalem","0","If you have any speculations what might have gone wrong here, I would love to read them.\n\nSubnautica Below Zero, what the Dock update:\n\nI uninstall the game on Steam and install it from scratch. I switch off cloud sync. No old savegames, I guess this is thanks to switching off cloud sync.\n\nI start a new survival game after the What the Dock update, save and continue several times. No problem at all.\n\nLast night, I save while standing in my small base (only 1 X base piece with 2 hatches, 1 multiprpose  & 1 scanner room), the seatruck (only base module) parked outside. Both are near the escape pod (near in the sense of only having to swim ten seconds from the pod to the base). The base had been built several game days before.\n\nI play a new game in creative mode, for a few hours. Not sure if this is related.\n\nWhen I restart the survival game today and continue from the last save, I see this:\n- Half my inventory is filled with snowballs. I only picked up snow one time and got rid of the snowball immediately, days before, so all of the snowballs are new. Not all inventory slots are filled.\n- All recipes are listed as known in the Wrench tab.\n- The recipes I KNEW at the point of save are flagged as NEW, although they are definitely NOT new. All the other recipes are NOT flagged, although they ARE new.\n- My base is gone. Gone is also the equipment stored inside and the resources stored in the base, in wall lockers (about 12 wall lockers). Other than those (about) 12 wall lockers in the multipurpose room, there were a standard work desk, a bed, three posters from Delta on the wall, and three chique plantters with nut trees. The connected Scanner Room had nothing in it. The X Compartment at the other end of the multipurpose room had 3 wall lockers and 2 hatches.\n- The truck and the escape pod are still there.\n- Nothing special visible about the area or plants \/ animals where the base was placed.\n\nI did not save again and was warned about the last save being 3 minutes old when I exited, so I guess the crazy save game still exists, if anyone would be interested in looking at it.\n\nAny idea what might have gone wrong, and how I could prevent this in the next game? Or does it remind you of a known Subnautica 1 bug?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/5875531492229056350/","12/01/2024 09:45:12","bug report"

"Stranded Deep","Survival","PINNED:Important Note from Beam Team","fluxtorrent","0","[quote=sam | Beam Team Games]Hi everyone,

With our recent launch on the Nintendo Switch, you can choose to play Stranded Deep on PC or the console of your choice. As we expand to other platforms – and as we prepare to launch another big new feature – there has become a need to keep the discussion in one place. So, moving forward, the official home for all Stranded Deep discussion will be our forums at: https:\/\/forums.strandeddeepgame.com\/

The Steam forums will continue to operate, but we will be directing all discussion and bug reports to our official forum from now on. This transition will help us and our community managers, Clare and Oisín (Night_Snake), to better identify and help with any issues you’re experiencing.

I’d like to personally say a big thanks to our volunteer Steam moderators: Omen3608, fluxtorrent, Skarmo and Cosmo. There’s no way Ben and I could have managed in the early days with how quickly our community grew. We really appreciate the huge time and effort you’ve put into the community.

As always, a huge thanks to everyone for your support!

Stay Alive! [\/quote]

"Stranded Deep","Survival","PINNED:RESOLUTION DEFAULTING TO 154x0","sam | Beam Team Games","7","Hi everyone,\n\nSome users have been sending in reports of the game attempting and failing to initialize the resolution to 154x0 at start up. We haven't been able to reproduce the problem on our end yet, but it seems to be caused by the resolution settings in the registry being corrupted. The good news is, it's fixable :)\n\n[h1][i]DISCLAIMER: The steps here are relatively straightforward, but if you don't feel comfortable modifying registry keys then we would advise against it.[\/i][\/h1]\n\n1. Open the Registry Editor (You can find this easier by typing \""regedit\"" in the Windows search bar, or pressing the Windows Key + R and then entering \""regedit\"").\n2. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\/Software\/BEAM Team Games\/Stranded Deep\n3. Locate the two entries responsible for resolution. They will be named similar to \""Screenmanager Resolution Height\"" and \""Screenmanager Resolution Width\"".\n4. You will need to change the width and height values to something \""safe\"" like 1024 wide x 768 high. Before doing that make sure \""Decimal\"" is selected, then enter your new resolution value for each entry.\n\nThat should get you going again. We're actively looking into why this is happening in the first place. It seems to happen with other games running the Unity engine as well so we'll be trying to get to the bottom of it asap.\n\n--\nStay Alive!\nBeam Team\n\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/313120/discussions/10/1636416951457732617/","12/01/2024 09:56:53","bug report"

"Stranded Deep","Survival","Can't dismantle raft base part...","Iced Tea","0","I know there's probably no solutions for this seeing as google gives me results from 2020 about people complaining about it and patch notes from years ago claiming to have fixed it, but dang it I invested 15 hours into this save so I have to try. \n\nAs the title says, I can't dismantle a barrel raft base part that I built onto my raft in a hurry thinking I could just take it apart and put it where I actually wanted it. I stripped literally everything off it, there are no sails, rudder, anchor, places to store boxes or anything that the raft bases could be connected to (other than each other) yet the game says \""this cannot be removes because it relies on a crafted item\"". It says that for every single raft base part, and flipping it upside down or trying to break it from other angles does nothing and still gives me this error.\n\nI really, really, really do not have the patience to scour another 10 islands to find enough tires and barrels to make a completely new raft, so if anyone has any solutions for this problem it would be greatly appreciated.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/313120/discussions/10/4030221636422489437/","12/01/2024 09:57:03","bug report"

"Stranded Deep","Survival","Shipwreck Island Completely Broken","Tony","2","To put it simple, I was playing singleplayer on my save and was looking for islands to loot, that is when I spotted it, the biggest ship I have ever seen in this game beached on a island. I did some research and realized I have found the one and only shipwreck island. I went to the island and that is when the glitches occurred. Before I have even step foot on the island when three glitches had happen. The first glitch was that I cannot pause the game, the only way was to tab out and force quit on the game. The second glitch was that I became a god, what I mean is that I had infinite health, oxygen, stamina, you name it. The third glitch was that sound was broken. All these glitches I either figured out on the island or on the boatride to it.\n\nOn the island, the boat that I saw wasn't even real. I saw posts online that the boat was actually accessible and had a interior, however for me it was completely different. There was no interior, since I can phase through the entire ship and saw that the ship had nothing inside. I check back to see my storage and realized that the game completely removed everything in my chests. I retried going to the island to see if it was a weird mishap that happen, but no, my 2nd and 3rd try going to the island the same glitches happened.\n\nI know there is no fixes for this and that the devs will probably not fix this (judging by how many glitches are still in the game), but I want to see if any of you guys have this glitch, or is it just something with my save that is causing this to happen.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/313120/discussions/10/3843304884863638403/","12/01/2024 09:57:54","bug report"

First one is \""Hunter Of The High Seas\"" basically I need to kill one boss. I killed the Megalodon and I didn't get the achivement then, I killed the giant eel no luck on that I still didn't get the achivement. The last boss the giant squid I killed it and finally got the achivement so, very weird I was expecting to get the achivement after killing my first boss but anyways that's one problem. \n\nNext is \""Call Me Ahab\"" (kill all the bosses) so after killing all the bosses to get that last achivement I didn't get this one so I was like \""Ok fair enough maybe I did something wrong?\"" So I made a new world and literally speed runned all the bosses in under 3 in game days and I still didn't get the achivement and yes I did collect the trophy of each boss after I killed it. (I just speed runned all the bosses again, collected the trophies and I got the achivement The first time I tried I collected all the trophies just after killing the last boss so the game still thinks i'm in the boss fight so it didn't trigger the achivement? But this time I went far away from the boss zone area and then collected the trophies and it worked very weird.)\n\nAnyways moving on, next is \""Horticulturalist\"" (have every possible crop farm in the game) so, I did make every farm (Aloe, Ajuga, Kura, Pipi, Potatoes, Quwawa) and didn't get the achivement. So I searched on Google and there's this \""plant\"" called \""Wavulavula\"" in the game then I was like \""Oh ok my bad I didn't see that plant any where i'll try to look for it.\"" so I searched all 25 islands, and no sign of that plant so either i'm blind or I did something wrong or the achivement is a bit funky. So help would be appreciated because right now, i'm abit confused with these achivements.

"Stranded Deep","Survival","Cant Disengage from raft and possibly other vehicles","m.mac86","7","Originally posted by m.mac86:\n\nI think what the poster meant is that when you pickup the paddle and then sit in the raft, the game bugs out and disables all but the movement functions. you cant even hit esc and enter the menu when this happens. i,m having the same problem and the only way to escape is to use task manager and end the process(hard reset). So not sorted. im stuck in the raft untill further notice. additionally, the game wont allow me to launch in full screen mode anymore. I've only started the game up about 10 times since download and this happend out of the blue. I've heard trying ALT+enter while in game fixes the full screen issue, but haven't tried it yet. will update once i troubleshoot more.\n\nUpdated by m.mac86\nALT+ENTER does fix the full screen issue, but these are 2 separate issues. Now im just stuck in the raft in full screen. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this did nothing as i dont know how to clear the game cache. I know this because all the custom settings i have set are still set after reinstalling. I dont know how to clear the cache after uninstalling as im new to steam.\n\nResponse from Cosmo and Fred:\nNot being able to escape whilst 'mounted' on the raft is by design as far as I am aware, you have to disengage from the raft to be able to use escape. Of course if you are unable to disengage from the raft that is most likely a bug and probably an idea to make a post in the bugs forum :)\n\n(m.mac86) Ill try a few other things and update this discussion with any further troubleshooting results, however there's not much you can do from the start of the game until you get to an island. im new to this game so i doubt i'll be able to evade the sharks and swim to the island. One thought i had off the hop is that it may have something to do with the tutorial goals interfering with the game functions, but i dont exactly know how the tutorial is embedded into the game. Some games allow you to skip the starting tutorial, but since the tutorial is literally the first few milestones in the game, i doubt that this is possible. Please respond if we already have a fix or any information on this. Also is somebody can direct me on clearing the game cache after uninstalling the game then i can reinstall under default game settings and see if that helps.\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/313120/discussions/10/2826511882826158024/","12/01/2024 09:59:23","bug report"

"Stranded Deep","Survival","When ADS (aiming), mouse accelerates unexpectedly.","sushileafbeats","17","I've noticed when trying to aim say a spear or a speargun, the camera will seemingly move at random speeds. I'll be slowly coasting left to right, then suddenly my camera jolts ahead and I've all of a sudden done a 180 turn. It's very jarring and game conflicting. Fighting anything is a terrible time, as half my attempts at aiming get jolted away from the target.

I've found one post on the internet about this, but there was never an answer given. But this means I'm not the only one. 

I've tried messing with the smoothing at different values, and it doesn't seem to fix it.

I've even reinstalled the game.

EDIT: A clip of the issue: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xYK_gY_eKgI
Notice how I move steadily without aiming a weapon, then when I aim a weapon that same steady motion becomes jumpy and irratic.

[b] EDIT 2: After further testing, I've found that while aiming down sights, if I pass my reticle over certain areas of the world, the movement of the reticle accelerates. So it's not random.

"Stranded Deep","Survival","Flying raft?","Dragão","0","I was on a custom island, and I decided to expand the ferry. But there came a time, when I went to put a support for the lamp, but I was startled when my boat capsized and went flying. Even with the four anchors I installed on it, the raft went flying. It stopped in the middle of the ocean and began to turn. I went, with the character, after her, but I couldn't get her back. The way out was to leave the game and return. Then I did the same work, installed the lamp holder, but the problem did not occur again.\nI ask developers not to abandon Stranded Deep. And think about new updates. One of them would be to solve this type of bug. Other suggestions would be: to enable the construction of a small base on the ferry (like a cabin). The other would be the possibility of changing the clothes of the character, who spends all his time in the game with the same clothes.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/313120/discussions/10/3184612220383371937/","12/01/2024 10:00:06","bug report"

"Stranded Deep","Survival","Bugs and glitches in version 0.90.10","RaptorRobb6ix","0","Fruits and vegetables spoiling when they’re still unpicked on land and dissapear!
It looks like the moment u step on an island the spoiling timer get activated. 

When you have 2 or more small crabs in inventory and then drop one it hurls away.

Ai animals broken? (absolute gamebreaker)

I’ve played 100 ingame days and only encountered 2 snakes, for example if you kill the 2 big crabs on a big island but it gets late and wait until next day, there is a good chance that all the other animals are gone!
I have seen several times small boars walking or hanging in the air (first day i arrive) and then they fall into the sea!
1 of the snakes i attacked with 1 crude spear (throwing) start turning around in circles and then flew away in the shallow water and turning around in circles underwater there!
Also sometimes when I threw a crude spear at a wild boar it runs to middle part of island and than disappear with all other animals!?! and when he attacks or (runs away) he also lift off the ground a few meters just like all other animals.
(Have seen pics off other ppl finding wild boars, little boars in sea, also big crabs hanging in the air and more crazy stuff going on!)

I also noticed that the seaguls, bats, … only came to my starter island (maybe also to the nearest islands around the starter island not sure!) but not on the further islands and the small crabs not really spawning back, mostly 1 spawn back on land (was always hanging on my pile coconuts :) and 2 in sea (even on starter island), normaly there around 8 spawn back every ingame week i think.

Sharks clipping through low water sand texture but also clipping alot through the character himself in open water without damage and seen a few 360° shark dances also. 


interact with meat on firepit sometimes don't work (mostly because the fuel to low, if u at few sticks or leaves u can interact again)

Unlimited drinkable coconuts in piles (drink coconut than put it back in pile
its drinkable again).

I took a shark repellent than went mining clay and got poisioned, had no antidote with me.
The next day i took another shark repellent and went back mining clay,
when i came out of the water i wasn’t poisoned anymore!?! No idea if it was the second shark repellent i used that unpoisioned me or something else, the only thing i did after taking the second shark repellent was mining abit more clay and caught 3 lion fish when i came back i saw me health was full again and me arm looked normal and the watch confirmed i wasn’t poisioned anymore?

Flickering shadows on islands further away from the starter island, i think the neighbour islands where still fine if i remember correctly but further away this annoying flickering shadows starts and when i looked at my watch there was a small shakiness going on when this flickering shadows are there.
The only way to get rid of it is disable shadows completely!

So many storms is that normal? like atleast every 2 days sometimes everyday??
This accually makes the game much easier (which i don’t like) because u never have to water your crops also less filling of the water still and no SPF to worry about.

Sometimes the leaves are still there under the water still while it says zero fuel or leaves.

When climbing a palm tree there was a lock or limit how high u could climb in earlier versions, now u get kicked out off the tree (and break legs) when u climb to high because the lock or limit is gone!
All palm trees have 1 coconut now there used to be trees with 2?

This game also needs muuuuuuuuch better draw distances!!! rocks on the side of the islands draw in very late, wrecks and textures look terrible from still pretty close distance.
Very far graphics option is not even a small island length b4 the lods chance to the lowest!
I'm playing with a low end 4gb 1050ti gpu 4gb system mem. Q9300 core duo quad cpu on windows 7 and can still play with most setting at high or ultra and very far draw with 30 fps
There much be a very very very very far draw option in settings :)","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/313120/discussions/10/5116650215577114490/","12/01/2024 10:01:13","bug report"

Came back a day later (Today) and suddenly im being attacked by sharks and other animals.\n\nAdditionally, The animals are not just aggressive but hyper aggressive and move in fast forward, they always know where you are, right now i have 2 sharks circling my raft in the shallows at 3-4 times their normal speed making it impossible to even get off my raft without getting grabbed, But even if i do step on land, all the boars and crabs (Large and Small) start making their way to me until i enter the water.\n\nPlease can we get a fix? seems like a bit of an urgent bug having an entire game mode break like this.\nI wanted passive mode, NOT HYPER AGGRESSIVE MODE.\n\nGame is unmodded and there are no custom Islands.\n\n*Edit* Additional note, Yesterday I also set up 4 gardens and watered them to full, when I just checked them, while their water is still full, every plant in them is showing as dry, dead bushes.\nThey were only planted 1 and a half in game days ago when the game was still 'passive'.\nSomethings really screwy and its irritating the hell outta me.\n\nSo in summery:\nUpon loading my passive game, all animals are hyper aggressive over very long distances, and sharks move in fast forward.\nFreshly planted and watered crops instantly died with zero reason too.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/313120/discussions/10/3191359376167557950/","12/01/2024 10:01:14","bug report"

Desde hace unos dias (creo que es por la actualizacion) al entrar a algun servidor carga perfecto, pero a la hora de poner Receiving Data entra al servidor pero se queda congelado, y sale el mensaje ""rust.exe dejo de funcionar""... lo peor es que hace una semana mas o menos estuve jugando perfectamente, por eso creo que es de la ultima actualización.

Lo probé todo, actualizar los drivers tanto de la gráfica como de los complementos (directx, .net framework, todo) desinstalar y volver a instalar tanto el rust como steam, dos veces cada uno, verificando integridad de la cache del juego, etc etc.. no se que mas probar.



PD: si esta discusion no va en esta seccion me gustaria que me dijeran donde puedo ponerla. Un saludo, tengan buen dia.

                   - En ella escribe ""terrain.pvt false"" sin las comillas

"Rust","Survival","Stuck - ""Opening Bundles"" or ""Waiting on Background Video""","Jenshae","45","I either get stuck on the message ""Opening Bundles"" with ~1770 FPS and my GPU going wild with ~95% usage or it sticks on ""Waiting on Background Video"".
Meaning that I do not even load the main menu.

Does anyone know any fixes or ways around this?

[i](The last time I had ""Waiting on Background Video"" I think it was fixed randomly with a reinstall, so for now, I guess I will just choke up some bandwidth and smash my hard drives by deleting and reinstalling it repeatedly.)[\/i]

What gives Steam Support, you got my money so screw me now? Easily over 400 Rust Skins where illegally traded away without my consent or knowledge and I want them back. This is what I wrote to Steam Support:\n\nGreetings, On or about the 16th of Oct, 2023, view in my Trade History, several Rust Skins were fraudulently traded from my account. I did not in any way, shape or form, authorize this trade yet my Rust Items are just gone. The account is a lv 1 account and is currently trade banned and I'd like my items back. I'd also like to know how this was even possible as I've had zero interactions with this person. I've noticed my Rust Inventory Items went missing and for the past two weeks have been trying to figure out what happened. Today I stumbled on to Trade History and found several items traded away and I'm here to say it was fraud. You can check my history and I don't trade; I think maybe 1 or 2 at the most but years ago. This trade needs to be reversed and I'd like my Rust Items back. I didn't think to view trade history because I simply don't make trades. I've invested a lot of money into this game and it's been stolen away. I was not hacked nor have I given anyone access to my account. I recently added a few friends but deleted them as they just seemed shady. Anything you can do to return these items would be greatly appreciated. Again view my Trade History, you will see a full page of over 100 Rust Skins stolen away in a single Trade that I did not Authorize. Please reverse this trade... See attached file for fraud trade date and account, Thanks...\n\nAgain each report was ignored, as in no reply, and closed with no resolve as my Rust Skins are still missing. I have two trades, a legit trade when I first stated playing Rust a few years ago, and this illegal trade stealing all my skins. This theft took time and Steam should not EVER authorize such a trade. Who is going to just GIVE over 400 Rust Skins away and get NOTHING for it. I want my Rust Skins back Steam, DO YOUR JOB...","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/252490/discussions/4/3969421533317460742/","12/01/2024 10:12:56","bug report"

Hello, I got banned while playing Rust on Steam (there are vacs or in-game ban(s) in the logs) I think it happened for no reason. I wasn't using any cheats or other programs.

"Rust","Survival","Water input says 108, but water barrel does not fill?","Znuggi","2","I tried creating a fairly long water pipeline. I used water pumps, setup large batteries near the lake and powered them with wind turbines and solar panels. I then ran a water pipe line and a electric line parallel to each other from the lake to my house. I extended the water hose every 50m by putting down a fluid switch and pump and applied electricity to it if it required it. I extended my electric cable every 50m by using an electric branch.\n\nI was able to do this from right side of the map into nearly the center of the map successfully. I probably used 30-40 fluid switch and pumps and electric branches along the way but I could constantly see \""water input 108\"" and \""water output 108\"" in every single fluid switch and pump along the way. \n\nBut just shortly before my house it seems to be bugging. On a water barrel I see \""input water 108\"". But it does not fill up. If I move the water barrel back to the last fluid switch and pump, then it fills up correctly.\n\nThe last station where it does not work the following is true:\n1. The fluid switch and pump has 108 input value and 108 output value.\n2. The fluid switch and pump has active electricity connected.\n3. The water barrel (which is connected to the fluid switch and pump) says \""108 water input\"", indicating that it is receiving water, but does not fill up.\n\nWhat can be the problem here? I was exiting to try creating a long water pipeline and see my large water catchers fill up fast, but what has worked for 30-40 fluid switch and pumps suddenly stops working for no apparent reason.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/252490/discussions/4/3108017414022758368/","12/01/2024 10:14:23","bug report"

This is since today\/yesterday, I played the content last week without any issue. \nI have a RX7800XT and in every other mission, it keeps up 120fps with everything in the options pushed to max and is just at 60-80% load.\nMy drivers are up to date, I tested both with DX11 and 12 but it makes no difference. FSR on or off makes no difference. \nMaybe its something only on AMD happens, I cant check this since every other in my clan who is on now has an nVidia and no problems with them.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/discussions/2/4038104984904872954/","12/01/2024 10:18:53","bug report"
"Warframe","Shooter","FYI: If you have noticable frame rate issues on the new sand tiles, the culprit is Volumetric Fog","Deraios","0","I would lose ~30% fps just by looking at some of the sand tiles but I wouldn't have guessed that they'd be making apparently heavy use of volumetric fog on these. The problem would only slightly diminish on lower settings but is completely remediated by turning volumetric fog off completely. Technically, you lose some visual fidelity but I don't think the game looks worse overall.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/discussions/2/4038104984933783909/","12/01/2024 10:18:53","bug report"

"Warframe","Shooter","I have really bad in-game stuttering","Vaerinth","0","Hello.\nSo I downloaded Warframe today and went through the tutorial without issue. As soon as I reached my ship I noticed stuttering. I restarted my game and it fixed the issue. I then loaded into the next mission and the stuttering came back. The stuttering seems to be associated with loading into a second instance of sorts. There is also a flash of light blue near the bottom of my monitor occasionally.\n\nTemperatures are fine with my 7800x3d not even pushing spikes of 65. 4070ti is also very comfortable at 60. The issue persists even when in the options menu. The game is fine until I load into that second instance it seems. Where for my first time playing it was fine in the tutorial zone, and stuttering in the ship. Upon restarting fine in the ship, stuttering when in the first earth mission.\n\nI thought a video of the problem might be helpful.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ldg6rRr4mEU\n\nThings I have tried\n1.Changing the game settings\/going to dx12\/V ysnc etc\n2.Changing NVIDIA control panel settings including, max frame rate, v sync, and power management\n3. Disabling every startup program except Microsoft in msconfig.\n3a. Manually ending everything else in task manger except what seemed like core files.\n4. Changing a security security setting (ASLR)\n5.Updating Drivers\n5a. Rolling back Drivers\n5b.Clearing Driver Cache\n5c.DDUing Drivers\n6.Reinstalling the game\n7. Turning off all overclock on my GPU\n8.Changing BIOS settings including XMP, and resize bar\n\nTemps are fine. No issues in any other games. Specific to Warframe. I did notice that where my GPU usually has a bit of coil whine normally, when the stutters\/freezes hit the coil whine stops. I hope that helps, I have been trying to solve it for 3 days and I am pretty much done with trying anything I can think of.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/discussions/2/4038104984916602224/","12/01/2024 10:19:20","bug report"

Fall to void and \/unstuck does not repair this and I cannot also swap to Operator, because it's \""ability\"" too. I got this during:\nCast first ability on Mirage (school Zenurik) = this ability is \""one cast\"" and due to \""ability in use\"" I'm instantly bugged, because You cannot \""recast\"" this ability until duration is 0, but ability in use is basically \""duration infinite\"" even when You fail to use this ability. So die is the only way.\n\nSame bug I also got on Gara with 4th ability (channeling), but when I got enough energy I could recast 4th ability, that removed this bug. But it was with school Unairu.\n\nThis led me to believe that this bug can be caused by both the \""one cast\"" and \""channeling\"" abilities. But when I look at the fact that the \""one cast\"" ability does not take energy immediately, but within 1s,... it works the same way as channeling.\n\nI'm not sure what exactly it is, but I got the same bug during Index with Excalibur Umbra. So it's probably cause when You use abilities on low energy, when this energy is taken away by game mechanics and the remaining energy does not cover the \""ability cost\"" for your ability. (Eximus stealing energy, -1 energy per s in Index, etc.)\n\nHope You repair this bug.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/discussions/2/4027970229981781021/","12/01/2024 10:20:37","bug report"

(from memory, may not accurate)\n + Complete a defense mission of at least level 30 without letting defense target taking damage. (from memory, may not accurate)\n\nBasic info:\n- Challenge riven is equipped on Xoris\/ Stropha and active (hence why I see the riven challenge when enter PoE).\n- Loadout: Titania + Ignis Wraith + Ocucor + melee weapon (Xoris\/ Stropha).\n- I watched guide video of someone doing exact same challenge (2nd challenge) with Titania and copy move-by-move, even using same weapon (Ignis Wraith).\n\nAfter hours of looking around for target, try different methods (kill them outright, find them on ground and try different skills, shuriken instead of guns), I came to conclusion this specific type of challenge may be bugged and may need investigate, hence this post for notice.\nIt is a tough one to gather more info because I have to search for target and each target I only have one chance at it.\nThank you.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/discussions/2/3948029052450779477/","12/01/2024 10:21:13","bug report"

"Warframe","Shooter","Game Freezing and Crashing after Wi-Fi failure","501stTrooperBMC","1","Hey, so long story short: After the Abyss of Dagath update dropped, my college wi-fi ended up crashing during a mission. Normally, that's not an issue. For the past two years I've been using college wi-fi and it's never as good as home wi-fi, but it never affected my game performance and only disconnected me back to the log in screen when the routers just went bad. That's how it was for the past year.\n\nThat wasn't the case this time. Instead, I was stuck in the mission for 10 minutes without being sent back to the log-in screen, unable to do anything. I resorted to manually closing the game via Task Manager, but when I logged back in, the problems started: FPS stutter, freeze-frames when I move around or move my cursor, crashing whenever I'm starting a mission public or solo, or going into open world islands like Fortuna and Deimos. Long loading times when I'm leaving those missions as completions (It took my computer 4 minutes to load from Fortuna to Orb Vallis and another 10 whole minutes to load from Orb Vallis BACK into Fortuna afterwards. 5 minutes of loading back into my orbiter from those same places as well with FPS and quality dipping significantly.\n\nI tried everything, updating drivers, Verifying and Optimizing Caches, Re-Installing the game FIVE TIMES, yet these problems still persist. I don't think hardware is the issue, because before these issues occurred I was having instant loading times and smooth FPS above 60. I don't use a high spec PC, my gaming laptop is more than capable of handling the game or else I wouldn't have been using it these past two years. If there are any other options\/suggestions out there anyone is willing to tell me would be great!","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/discussions/2/3873718561391917091/","12/01/2024 10:21:49","bug report"

Also, no third party software solutions please, I don't want to switch to one of these ONLY for Warframe.[\/H1]\n\nEver since the Wisp Prime update, I can't use my DualSense without runing into many issues, and now that I have a Dualsense Edge, it seems to get worse.\n\n My main issues here are as follows:\n\n[list]\n[*]Gyro goes crazy whenever I switch between melee and guns. You can replicate this by having anything that trigger Gyro turning it on, and then switching Action Sets; for instance, set your Gyro to turn on when you hold any button, then hold said button and move your controller, and then do a quick melee.\n\n[*]For whatever reason I can't understand, I can't hack any console because I use Circle for \""Context Menu\"" and Square for \""Quick Melee\"", but Circle is also \""Back\"" on the damn Menu action set, which for whatever reason triggers as soon as the game switches to said action set (which is as soon as I start hacking resulting on an instant cancel).\n\n[*]I can't use Legacy signals (i.e. assing a button to be an Xbox controller button) for whatever reason; whenever I try it sends absolutely no signal and renders useless said button.\n\n[*]Also, I can't get rid of Melee Action Set because for some reason, It will be back as an empty setup, which means my controller dies as soon as I switch to melee (even with a quick melee)\n[\/list]\n\n As far as I can tell, these issues are on Valve's regard since I've seen them happen on other games that use Native Input (No Man's Sky), and I've exposed these issues to the community and DE in various ways, but it seems to be a useless endeavor, so if anyone knows a way to work around these issues or fix them, I'd like to know.\n\n Thanks for your attention.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/discussions/2/3873718133739054859/","12/01/2024 10:22:06","bug report"

i tried restarting the game and opening\/closing the config menus, and yes i did validate etc on the launcher which i do after every update. tried restarting steam. tried changing around the config as i said. 
about to delete the steam download cache and restart my pc, if that doesn't fix it then i will be unable to play the game as i don't own a pc mouse. so fun
edit: nope. didn't fix it. :\/
disabling steam input entirely also didn't make a difference.

If someone, usually the host, for some reason tells the game \""No, I don't want to go there\"" either by disconnecting or just canceling their mission countdown, the railjack will still attempt to change maps. Because one person is unable or unwilling to change maps, the railjack will still take off, but will never arrive, and because it seems the only way to get off a railjack is to go to dry dock, everyone's just stuck.\n\nI discovered this because someone was in a hurry to get out of a mission, but there was a bunch of stuff in space I wanted to collect.

I've experimented with making custom bindings for it, but I don't see a reason to sit for 5 or 6 hours just to bind your inputs to work almost like an actual controller, but not precise enough to be considered an actual controller being used. With default settings, I've only been able to use the camera and pan it around my orbiter while also only having the jump function, but other than that, my controller has no function whatsoever. I also attempted to reset in-game binds to default as well, but it doesn't work.

La misión principal cuando te toca desbloquear un cofre, no se abre y se queda asi obligándote irte de la misión (perdiendo todo el farming). Jugué como 45 mins para farmear unos trinsectos 280 mas materiales para Kulervo, perdí todo y al tener poco tiempo libre me fastidio.

En otra misión, una persona se desconecto y me obligaron a reconectarme a la misión teniendo 200 trinsectos y mas materiales para Kulervo. Me echo a la nave luego salio lo de reconectarse a la partida y le di. Toda mi recompensa mi 1 hora jugada en esa mision, desaparecio sin mas.

Simplemente increíble, perdí el tiempo nada mas. Porfavor arreglen los bugs asi que no dan ganas de jugar warframe si sigue.","es","Hello good afternoon, these days I have been playing a lot of duviri and I have had some problems that already started to bother me. The main mission when it comes to unlocking a chest, it does not open and it stays like this forcing you to leave the mission (losing all the farming). I played like 45 minutes to farm some 280 more materials for Kulervo, I lost everything and having little free time annoyed me. In another mission, a person disconnected and forced me to reconnect to the mission having 200 trisectos and more materials for Kulervo. I took the ship then went out to reconnect to the game and I gave him. All my reward my 1 hour played on that mission, disappeared without more. Simply incredible, I lost the time nothing more.

Time and Resources are being wasted because of these persistent bugs, as they persist even after the latest Duviri Bug Patches. Below is the list of the ANNOYING BUGS PLAYERS ARE EXPERIENCING.\n\n1. FINDING THE HIDDEN CHEST (Duviri Experience)\nUp to this date, this mission has not been resolved. Sometimes, the CHEST is locked, which can be quite annoying.\n\n2. NO UNDERCROFT MISSIONS OR OBJECTIVES. YOU ARE JUST LOCKED INSIDE THE UNDERCROFT.\nWhen you enter the Undercroft, you become locked inside without any missions or objectives. If it forces you to QUIT and LEAVE Duviri, your progress is wasted.\n\n3. AFTER KILLING JACKAL (DUVIRI CIRCUIT), YOU GET STUCK INSIDE.

There's no possible way that I haven't gotten 100 stealth kills across 1400 hours!\n\nAnd as I log in, I can confirm, these challenges have in fact been completed? My only guess is that perhaps some of these achievements have been completed at a point where I'd lost internet connection, as in being at 99 Stealth Kills, losing internet, therein Steam disconnects, while Warframe allows me to continue playing so long as I stay in my instance; get my 100th Stealth kill which DE, and my In Game account recognizes, reconnect and thusly Steam never received the information that I met the qualifications for an achievement.\nSurely I don't have to like.

"DayZ","Shooter","Frozen Wildlife","TWD Kenny","1","Today, I decided to sit down and play a little bit of DayZ. Now, just before I say anything, i'm very new to the game (got it for my birthday last week) and I have NO IDEA where this happened. All I know is that I was scavenging some homes next to the coast when I saw 4 or 5 deer just frozen in place.

 I was able to kill each and every one of them, but there were no sound effects from them, nor were there any reactions to the hits I gave them. When one of them died, their body dissappeared in thin air and no meat was left behind. Little blood spurts would pop out when I hit said deer as well. They died within maybe 4 or 5 hits with a damaged kitchen knife, but they were seemingly invulnerable to my unarmed attacks. 

 Not sure if this is a known bug, or if this only happens with the deer, but I thought I should bring it up for future notice and fixing.

"DayZ","Shooter","TENGO PROBLEMAS CON EL AUDIO AYUDAA","MazapanSensual","0","¿No hay sonido después de entrar al juego?
Oye, no tanto para mí como para mi hermano, a quien realmente le encanta este juego, pero nos hemos encontrado con un problema realmente molesto:

Cada vez que intenta iniciarlo, el juego tiene audio normal hasta que se carga. A veces hay una especie de sonido de clic agudo y eso es todo, todo el audio simplemente desaparece. Sin respirar, sin correr, zombies, disparos, nada.

Hemos intentado utilizar diferentes dispositivos de audio, audífonos, audífonos, parlantes, etc., pero no producen sonido. Cuando inicias en la pantalla del personaje, el audio es totalmente normal, suena la música y todo. Sólo cuando lo cargas realmente el sonido se detiene. Cuando vuelves al menú de personajes, el sonido *no* regresa y continúa desapareciendo. Reiniciar el juego permitirá que se recupere el audio, pero solo hasta que vuelvas a jugar.

Es más, podemos confirmar que sólo el sonido del juego se ve afectado, y sólo en DayZ. Otros juegos de Steam, juegos de Origin e incluso videos de YouTube pueden reproducirse en segundo plano, aún produciendo sonido, incluso reproduciéndose en DayZ, pero DayZ no hace ningún ruido.

Además de probar hardware diferente, intenté actualizar DirectX, incluso directamente desde el archivo y desde un navegador web. También intenté eliminar archivos .cab como sugirió un lugar, y también verifiqué para asegurarme de que estén seleccionados los dispositivos de audio correctos y que la aplicación no esté silenciada.

También intenté desinstalar y reinstalar el juego, pero no tuvo ningún efecto.

Nuevamente, otros juegos funcionan bien, los dispositivos de audio funcionan bien, es específicamente DayZ y nada más. ¿Alguien tiene alguna idea sobre qué podría solucionarlo? Pasé todo el día navegando por la web en busca de respuestas, profundizando lo suficiente en los resultados de búsqueda de Google como para encontrar Roblox, así que no creo que vaya a encontrar la respuesta allí, pero si alguien que tiene más conocimientos de tecnología que yo ( Lo cual no es decir mucho) podría ayudarnos, se lo agradeceríamos mucho.","es","No sound after entering the game? Hey, not so much for me as for my brother, who really cares about this game, but we have encountered a really annoying problem: Every time you try to start it, the game has normal audio until it is charged. Sometimes there is a kind of sharp click sound and that’s all, all the audio just goes away. Without breathing, without running, zombies, shootings, nothing. We have tried to use different audio devices, hearing aids, speakers, etc., but do not produce sound. When you start on the character screen, the audio is totally normal, the music sounds and everything. Only when you really load it the sound stops. When you return to the character menu, the *no* sound goes back and continues to disappear. Restarting the game will allow you to recover the audio, but only until you return to play it. It’s more, we can confirm that only the sound of the game is not affected, and only in DayZ. Other games of Origin and even web videos of YouTube could be reproduced in second plane, still producing sound, even reproducing at any devices than at DayZ.","https://steamcommunity.com/app/221100/discussions/5/5513030717664071485/","12/01/2024 10:34:12","bug report"

Because the moment I try to pick up objects from the environment and pass them to my backpack, I can't pick up the items.\nIn-game items are inactive, so I can't get them into my character's hands and I can't use them. Every now and then I get kicks from the server and I get errors 0x00030002 and I can't log in to the server ... The buttons in the game menu are not active, I press play to log in to the server and nothing happens. I get error information 0x000400F0 ...Another problem is the lack of a list of official servers in the menu, in order for them to appear, I have to turn the game on and off, they show up only after a few times. It's really annoying before the game was running normally until now. I've also tried resetting my modem and internet connection, but that doesn't help either. I've tried uninstalling and installing battle eye and deleting and reinstalling dayz but it only helps for 10 minutes then the problem reappears.It all started after the last update, the game is completely unplayable.

"DayZ","Shooter","Black screen/Hard reboot","NuclearDude97","0","The game worked perfectly the first day, but since then I can't play this game because it crashes my pc on a black screen, sometimes with the gpu fan at full speed (on the black screen). Only a hard reboot works to get my pc going again, on the first time my pc took 4 times longer to restart, with a weird black screen and a circle spinning. I can play games with higher system requirements than Dayz without any problem. I also noticed that Dayz heats up my cpu more than other games (70°~75°), I have games that struggle to run, but don't heat up my cpu that much (50°~60°). I did a quick test (about 40 minutes), and apparently, when playing at the lowest preset the black screen problem disappeared (temperature still 70°+), but we started having connection problems frequently, my friend was hosting and even he was being kicked off his server (that's why I couldn't test more). Certainly these constant sudden crashes\/shutdowns and hard reboots are not healthy for the hardware and the lowest preset isn't the most pleasant to play with. So now me and my friend are too scared to risk it.

Game Ver. 1.21 (stable)
Steps to reproduce: Join a private server and play normally on default graphics quality. (High I believe). It can take more than an hour or 10 minutes to happen. It seems that when it starts to happen, it keeps happening with an interval of about 15 minutes

This needs to be fixed it makes the game unplayable. Play for hours to get geared up only to catch even the common cold and have it never go away. Even if you are lucky to find pills and vitamins it wont cure you, My current record is 36 tetra pills and 20 vitamins on a single character, max food water and blood and temp and still sick. Don't know how i managed to get so lucky to find that many, but pointless if they do nothing at all. The devs need to stop adding pointless ♥♥♥♥ and address the game breaking problems that already exist. I love the game to death but its ♥♥♥♥ like this that turns so many diehard fans away from the game.

I uninstalled, re-installed the game several times, changed my mouse, I went into full screen mode, and finally this problem that made the game unplayable was resolved (I don't really know how).\n\nBut now I have another problem: I can't use many items in the game.\nAgain, I uninstalled the game several times to reinstall it, and my problem persists: I can't interact with some objects, which prevents me from playing the game correctly.\nFor example, I starved to death when I I had a small jar of food in my hands, but I couldn't open it (and it wasn't canned food but a small jar of dough). I had the mouse icon on the bottom left of the screen with \""open\"" noted, the icon was showing the left mouse button. I tried to hold it, nothing happened. The same goes for compasses, vitamins, and even putting wood in a fireplace to make a fire when I had all the necessary equipment. What bothers me is that it worked once or twice, but it doesn't work anymore. I had the objects in hand for all these cases. \n\nI tried to associate another button for the object action (for example the \""u\"" key on my keyboard at random), nothing happens when I press it either.\nI add that I did not install any mod, just the game as it is offered.\n\nThank you for your attention, and hoping that there is a solution to my problem.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/221100/discussions/5/3829792183364625693/","12/01/2024 10:38:07","bug report"

"DayZ","Shooter","Кидает персонажа каждый вход по карте","Panda","1","Добрый день! Вчера заметил странности при входе на сервер DayZ NL 3664683 (Public).
Суть в чем: Я играю на (своем основном) официальном сервере DayZ NL 3664683 (Public), но вчера решил посетить другой официальный сервер для игры и обнаружил при входе на сервер задержку входа в 75 секунд, в сообщении написано было что это связано с переходом между серверами, после чего я зашел на сервер и удивился что одет в то же в чем был на предыдущем сервере, абсолютно все то же что я носил на персонаже ранее, а находился я в лесу вдали от берега.
Я решил зайти на другой сервер официальный и ситуация повторилась, тот же лут при мне, я решил перепроверить это, выстрелив из оружия и оставил 5 патрон в магазине, зашел на следующий сервер и там тот же лут при мне и то же количество патронов (5) в магазине. Все бы ничего, так когда я вернулся на свой основной сервер где играю с другом, меня так же перенесло по карте в сторону берега, а были мы на ТИСах.
Я попросил друга сделать то же самое, зайти на другой официальный сервер и вернуться на наш основной и его так же кинуло на берег, мы оба были недалеко от Березино но ближе к середине карты чем обычно появляющиеся персонажы с нуля у самого берега.
Все бы ничего, мы поняли что это работает когда мы переходим между серверами, но! Вчера мы вышли из игры на нашем основном сервере DayZ NL 3664683 (Public) и сегодня утром я решил один зайти поиграть и меня снова перекинуло в другое место (Дубровка), при этом сервер я не менял! Хорошо, добежал до нашего места, поиграл немного и вышел, через полтора часа зашел снова и опять я в другом месте. При этом каждый мой вход сегодня в игру сопровождался задержкой в ожидании 75 сек при переходе между серверами, но я не переходил! Захожу в игру только с лаунчера из раздела ""Избранные сервера"" где сервер DayZ NL 3664683 (Public) один единственный в списке. Что происхдит?","ru","Good afternoon!

I decided to go to the other server for the official and the situation was repeated, the same thing was me, I decided to double it, by firing it, and leaving 5 am in the store, we went to the next server and there was the same lute at the same time as I was on the previous server, and the same number of am in the store.","https://steamcommunity.com/app/221100/discussions/5/3453716885193060481/","12/01/2024 10:45:05","bug report"

[i]You can find the sources to threads where people found workaround\/solutions at the bottom of this post.[\/i] [b]Do notice these are not a guaranteed fix.[\/b]

[h3]PlayStation 5 Costumers:[\/h3]
* The correct version of PD3 was just rolled out [url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/PAYDAYGame\/status\/1704065716243038531]11:30 CET\/02:30PDT\/05:30EDT\/18:30JST[\/url] - 
---------------------------------------


[h3]Infamous\/Milestone rewards\/redemption issue PD2 > PD3:[\/h3]
1. [strike]Should be solved at or before launch.[\/strike] [i](This might resolve once the servers have been fixed)[\/i].
[u]Make sure you have claimed your rewards on the website.[\/u]
[i](If you can't claim then restart PD2 and have the game open for a few minutes)[\/i]
---------------------------------------


[h3]If you are having issues with Matchmaking for over 10 minutes:[\/h3]
1. Restart your game.
2. Opt out of Crossplay.
3. Add and invite people, refer to [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/1272080\/discussions\/3\/]Steam LFG[\/url] or discord.
4. [strike]Server's are overloaded.[\/strike] (They're doing as massive effort in fixing the servers).
---------------------------------------


[h3]Inventory issues\/perks\/Sentries ect:[\/h3]
- [I]In the game lobby you have to equip your loadout by pressing ""R"". (Thanks to Yuri Keller)[\/I]
1. Try restarting your game or see Loadout below.
2. Equip default mask & restart your game [i](Thanks Charsjust)[\/i]
3. Tooltips are incorrect - In other words lvl up more (lvl 12-18 has been said to unlock stuff).
4. Server's might need to update your progress.
5. Playing a few more heists might also help
6. Its a bug.
- The server's are likely the culpit.
---------------------------------------


[h3]Loadout locked\/invalidated & unable to swap character:[\/h3]
1. Complete the first mission [i](Thanks to timmy)[\/i]
2. Buy the weapon slot(s).
3. Restart your game after 1 & 2. [i](thanks to N4D1N3 for confirming)[\/i]
4. Verify game files.
Otherwise you can try finding a workaround or wait till a fix is implemented.
[i][u](Silver or gold ED does not affect this issue)[\/u][\/i]
---------------------------------------


[h3]Not receiving any Experience(EXP):[\/h3]
1. Completing Challenges gives you Infamy Points(EXP). [i](Thanks to Nuko & Mordtziel)[\/i]
---------------------------------------


[h3]Resolution workarounds:[\/h3]
1. Set the game to full-screen & restart the game. [i](Thanks to Tipsy McStagger)[\/i]
2.  Right click desktop > display > set scaling to 100% then restart game if you need to. [i](Thanks to Alex)[\/i]
3. Edit the game file, [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/1272080\/discussions\/0\/5291222824586125039\/]see this tread[\/url]
---------------------------------------


[h3]If you can't download the game having purchased Silver or Gold Package:[\/h3]
[i]- Still having Beta installed could be the Culprit? [\/i]
1. Restart steam multiple times [b](make sure steam is closed in the task manager)[\/b].
2. Update steam: ""Steam"" top right corner > Check for Steam Client Updates > Restart steam like step 1 once.
3. Log out & back in to Steam.
4. Use the Mobile App to download PD3. [i](Some have said this works and doesn't work)[\/i].
5. Repeat 1 until it works.
6. Open a support ticket with steam.
[i]- Steam is most likely overloaded or some other steam EA issue.[\/i]
---------------------------------------

[h3]Game is running but nothing happens[\/h3]
[B] If your game is launched\/running and there is no visual change or the application doesn't start\/pop up apart from a blue spinning wheel for 10-30sec or launches after a while (+10mins) and blackscreens try deleting OpenXR: ""Payday3 folder > Engine > Binaries > ThirdParty > Delete ""OpenXR"""".  [\/B] If that doesn't work, run both Steam & PD3 exe's with ""Run as admininstrator"" compatability. [i](Verifying the files will just recover OpenXR so don't do that. and IF THAT doesn't work then refer to below.)[\/i]

[h3]If you can't install\/run the game:[\/h3]
[b]Notice: [\/b] [i]Running 2 GPU's\/Multi-monitor set-up can be the issue due to driver(s) (see the last thread in Sources ""GPU\/VR"").[\/i]
0. Disable Overlays (E.g Geforce, xbox, discord, VR)
1. Run steam as Administrator.
2. Run Payday 3 as Administrator.
3. Set -dx12 or -dx11 as launch parameters. [i](Try both, DX12 is not supported but can still work)[\/i]
4. Remove ""Read-Only"" from your Steam folder(if you install games on another drive repeat that there as well)\/game folder.
5. Double check your harddrive(s) so they aren't almost full.
6. Clear steam cache (In Settings > Download).
7. Add the game\/folder to the Firewall.
8. Check so your antivirus aren't interfering.
9. Verify the game cache.
10. Reinstall the game.
11. Try installing the game in C: (Sometimes this works) or an SSD.  - [i](Thanks to Ο ΚΑΘΑΡΗΣΤΗΣ).[\/i]
12. Repair windows (scanhealth)
13. Double check your Bios version is up to date.
14. Make sure you have Chipset, lan ect drivers for your Motherboard
15. Restarting your PC could solve the issue.
Finally double check you're not missing Directx12 or Visual Studio or that your other drivers are up-to-date.
* [strike][i]Nvidia is working on a solution for Epic Games users, contact Nvidia if you have issues. [\/i][\/strike]  [b] Nvidia handed out a driver update to fix that problem.[\/b]
- If all else fails and googling doesn't help i recommend a [b]Clean Windows Install[\/b] ([u]Your windows install could be faulty.[\/u] Clean Install means formating\/deleting the C:\ drive and its partitions then pressing ""New"" on the same harddrive afterwards).  
{MAKE SURE YOU [b]DON'T[\/b] FORMAT\/DELETE YOUR OTHER HARDDRIVES! There's plenty guides on google.}
---------------------------------------


[h3]If the game is crashing\/lag\/stutter:[\/h3]
[i]- For unknown\/access violation see 7.[\/i]
1. Change Liberty mask to something else (It can crash ur game due to Directx12) [i][Thanks to JL\/Underdrill][\/i]
2. Set -dx12 or -dx11 as launch parameters. - [i]Some have said dx12 can cause performance issues\/unable to start the game as DX12 isn't supported.[\/i]
3. Shaders could be the culprit.
4. Turn down Shadows setting.
5. Enable V-sync.
6. Verify the integrity of the game files.
7. Restart your PC. [i](Thanks to Xaanit)[i]
6. Turn down everything to the lowest settings
7. Open Nvidia Control Panel  > ""Manage 3D Settings"" > Restore Defaults.
8. UE has a thing where you stutter the first time of occurrence.
[i](Special thanks to Chickenburger)[\/i]
8. Try one of the run\/install solutions above.
---------------------------------------


[h3]Nebula Error Login workaround:[\/h3]
[b]- I want to add that due to the servers being overloaded [i](They are fixing them and as a result you are likely going to experience this error.)[\/i], its entirely possible this workaround is irrelevant. [\/b]
1. Restart your game.
[strike]2. Remove 2nd auth temporarily.[\/strike] [i]- [url=https:\/\/twitter.com\/PAYDAYGame\/status\/1704889522121531841]This should be resolved.[\/url][\/i]
3. [strike]Log in to the Nebula > Unlink steam account > Restart Payday 3 > Create a new Nebula account in the game > close the Neubla Window without Linking > Log in. (Thanks to BabyDontBlockMe)[\/strike] - [b]This is no longer relevant and all ur stuff is linked to ur account. [\/b]
4. Contact support: https:\/\/nebula.starbreeze.com\/support
 [i][b]Nebula Support is ONLY in regards to your Nebula account.[\/b][\/i] 
---------------------------------------


If all above fails then it could be some other reason that i do not know of and strongly advice to go to their Bug forums or creating a support ticket (hyperlink at the start).

[i](I am unaffiliated with Starbreeze and these aren't solutions or fixes, they're meant to try to pinpoint the possible culprit to what might be causing your problem while hopefully solving it. Additionally quite a few of the problems might be solved when the serves are working properly.)[\/i]

"Payday 3","Shooter","PINNED:RULES and FAQ for the Bug Reporting subforum.","BBK","0","Hey everybody, welcome to the Bug Reporting Subforum !

This subforum was created to provide you guys a platform where you can share with us technical issues you encountered when playing Payday 3 through steam, from simple graphical glitches to much more inconvenient problems like crashes or features working incorrectly.

[h1]Rules for the bug report forum and how to report a bug:[\/h1]
 [*] When making a topic in this subforum, please make sure to check if it has not been reported before or that a suitable solution has been listed in the rest of this topic. Please use the search function first.
 [*] Check if the bug has been listed in the “Known Issues” topic. Also use the search function to see if it’s already been reported in case it wasn’t added yet.
 [*] If the issue has been reported, see if you have anything interesting to add to that report. If possible, please include a screenshot or a video.
 [*] When writing your report, please be as thorough as possible when explaining the situation, any detail might be helpful. The more information you provide the more likely it is that the developers can find the problem.
 [*] Avoid posting multiple bugs in the same topic or post if you can please. As much as the idea of one topic handling every bugs is cool, this just makes it confusing for the developers to read, understand and send to each others. One issue per post is really the format we recommend for bug reporting.
 [*] Please add a tag to the title on the post to help specify the type of issue. Here’s some examples of tags you can use: 
	◦	[ART] Art related issues in general, like characters, weapons .
	◦	[ART: *LEVEL NAME*] for clipping and texture issues in level as well as placement of props.
	◦	[GAME PLAY: *LEVEL NAME*] for issues related to how the interactions and objectives work.
	◦	[WEAPON: *WEAPON NAME*] for various issues related to weapons.
	◦	[CRASH] for crashes
	◦	[AI] for issues related to AI issues 
	◦	[SOUND] for issues related to the audio of the game (sound effects or voice lines)
[*] Finally, when you do post a bug make the title as descriptive as possible. It will help both the developers and players to understand what your issue is about.

[h1]How we handle posts:[\/h1]
 [*] New issues: This is a bug that has not been reported before and is unknown to the developers. Once the issue has been tested, it will appear as a post in the Known issues sticky thread with a short description of the bug and a link to the topics of peoples who reported it before. When a fix has been made and included in a patch, the issue will be removed.

 [*] Old bugs that resurface: These bugs are best posted in new threads, Referring to the old and\/or locked thread is fine if the a user so wishes. The new report should still be treated like a new issue.	

 [*] Issues that do not require a patch, for example; Crashes related to Hardware, Drivers or other software. Issues confirmed to be mod related. Issues where the thread owner has misunderstood an achievement or game-play element. These issues will not appear in the Confirmed Bugs thread. The threads will be dealt with on a case by case basis. They may be left open for other users to ask questions on how to solve the same or similar issues or that may be locked on the thread owners, moderators or Overkill staff’s request if the issue is resolved. 
	
 [*] Known Issues and bugs: Sometimes a lot of reports may be posted about the same issue. These issues will be handled in three different ways. We will try to reply to as many as possible but we might not be able to reply to all of them. We will try to merge threads with new and relevant information. If there is no new information in the thread we will ether ask for more information in case the user has anything more to add to the related issue. Sometimes we may lock threads if we feel there is no need to merge and we have all the information we need. A link to the currently active thread about the issue should be provided.

The only threads that will be deleted will be so with the approval from, or request of the owner of the thread. We will strive for locking rather than deleting, we do reserve our self the right to lock without prior confirmation it cases this was needed. A thread can be deleted without prior confirmation if it's needed due to general forum rules. Threads will be locked with the intention of not having new posts be made in them and new reports should be make instead but the old thread can still be found and referred to.

All this is to keep the forum easy to navigate both for us here at Starbreeze and the users in the forum. This is not about removing unwanted threads it's about making our work easier and faster.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/1272080/discussions/4/5291222824586016170/","12/01/2024 10:48:38","bug report"

Since noone ever goes these side coridors it's pretty much safe to leave him here.\nOr it was\n\nFirst couple of times when the search was triggered guards \""found\"" that employee in a matter of seconds, like 5-10 seconds max - basically insta-alarm, as if they [b]directly walked to him[\/b].\nLesson was learned, all civs were killed(easier to transport) and brought at the top of the stairs under the van location, near the door. Basically a location guard can't \""accidentally\"" wander in.\n\nAnd then the unspeakable happened. At another search triggered - all the guards around went directly from the train yard to that door, like one after another they went up the stairs, directly to the corpses location, \""found\"" them and triggered an alarm. Again, in a matter of seconds.\n\nIt happens not just [b]consistently[\/b], it happens EVERY TIME. They know where they can trigger the alarm and ruin the heist for you - and they go for it.\n\n[b][CASE 2][\/b]\nHappened not once and not even twice, when you loot the train car and leave the bags inside, guards may in some magical way sense them. Looks like this - all doors are closed, bags are deep inside the train car, nothing clips outside (hello clipping bug btw), guard was casually walking around...SUDDENLY he stops, starts menacingly WALK AROUND THE WHOLE TRAIN for like a minute, then walks inside the train car, goes to the far end where the bags were hidden, looks at bags and launches the search.\n\nWhich, in turn, causes the guards to go towards nearest civ-body and sound the alarm.\n\nFUN","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/1272080/discussions/4/4031350479985112214/","12/01/2024 10:48:41","bug report"

"Payday 3","Shooter","SurpBugs","Kasiornis","1","So, art gallery. Suprhaze. Whaterver.\n\n1)When you place Zipline at the very beginning, mask up and use it, chances are high servers (hello always online, love to have you) won't recognize your position and throw you from the zipline. It looks like this: you use it - you make it to the end - at the end it teleports you 5 meters back, 5 meters down. On the ground floor. Where all the civs are walking. This bug is [b]consistent[\/b], happens each time 1st try this heist, and chances are high it's an insta-alarm.\n\n2)Also guards seing bags on Zipline from [b]VERY[\/b] far away. Even if you check with micro-cameras, there is a good chance they'll see the bags on a zipline from the other side of 2nd floor like 500m away or the guard on the ground floor will notice them with his arse while they are flying above him. The detection is [b]way too generous[\/b] for the guards and it makes the whole zipline asset highly questionable to use. It's like a no-brainer to have it, but detection shenanigans are just crazy.\n\n3)Map lag. Map is big enough and (hello always online again, still love to have you) it frequently lags, coincidentally at the moment someone notices you and launches detection meter. Also often teleports you to \""2 seconds back position\"". Often in front of a guard or civ. Just love it. What's with teleporting on this map anyway?\n\n4)Best one. Ground floor, forgot the number, room with alarm floor. In the middle of the room there are two stone spheres you can climb on to reach the switch. Due to the very same [b]ALWAYS ONLINE[\/b] it may do another funny lag. And even if you only press \""space\"" in front of them without pressing anything else - they'll [b]RICOCHET[\/b] the player 2-3 meters away from them. Into. The. Bloody. Floor. With alarm.

May be intentional.

"Payday 3","Shooter","Hacking guard's radios sometimes doesn't work","Beanie","2","Usually, when a guard sees you, and they want to escort you out of a private area, you can hack their radio to stop them,making them inspect their radio, forget about you and go back to whatever they were doing before. Sometimes however, you hack their radio, walk away, and after they're done being interrupted, they aparently remember that they were escorting you, the circle reappears and they go \""Hold it!\"" because obviously by the time they're done insepcting their radio, you're long gone. So because you're gone, they act like they normally do when they escort you and you run out of their circle and they go to arrest you, which quite sucks.\nOther times, you distract them by hacking their radio, but the escort symbol\/exclamation point above their head doesn't disappear, as it usually does. Basically the game says they're still allerted. However after they're done expecting their radio, the symbol disappears like usual.\nI'd say most of the time it work perfectly normal, you can just hack a guards radio to interrupt whatever they're doing and get away, but it sucks that sometimes randomly, they seem to just ignore having been interrupted and continue their action, ruining stealth runs.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/1272080/discussions/4/3952532649333987887/","12/01/2024 10:51:26","bug report"

"The Talos Principle 2","Puzzle","Probably solved the S1 pandora laser wrong by ""cheating"" [spoilers]","keyofw","1","So... I found the green emitter in S1 and managed to connect it to the connector on the high rock just outside puzzle 2. Then got stuck and was wandering around. I eventually solved this puzzle by getting a connector out of puzzle 8: Switcheroo at which point it was trivial to find an angle on a spot on the bridge between puzzles 7 and 8. But I am 99% sure I'm not supposed to do that, mostly because I don't think you're supposed to get the connector out of Switcheroo at all. It was kind of jank. I just stood on a box at the furthest edge of the platform holding the flame emitter and took a running leap at the entrance. On my first try the connector automatically dropped at the purple gate and managed to stay balanced *on top of it,* making it completely irretrievable. But on the second go I was able to clear the gate entirely.\n\nForgive me for using drive links instead of steam screenshots, but here are a couple of pics if you want to see what I did:\n\nThe connector from Switcheroo, outside the puzzle: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1uH1EHbfXgS6ytKIEhiLTW0uUHMSpRKbQ\/view?usp=sharing\n\nA view into Switcheroo which might show you what I did: https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1127Kwiz0IzZ1wAircGj2dIJ1U8tIZC5f\/view?usp=sharing","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/6208841617670347563/","12/01/2024 10:55:35","bug report"

I'm really liking the game and hope someone on the dev team can see this but for my money, there's a few problems with the game I would at least like to know are being worked on\n\n-Conversation closeups cause severe ghosting on almost any upscaling option. DLAA seems to be the only way to really mitigate them. It's really annoying\n-Framegen still cannot be enabled on current Nvidia drivers :(\n-Performance fluctuates too heavily in the open enviroments. (9900KF, 4080) I hope this can be improved.\n- The game is Steam Deck Verified but the performance there needs some love. I really hope you can look into making it run better on a handheld\n- Wwhen I enable a framerate cap the game tends to drop below it... which doesnt happen when I raise it. Meaning, say i cap at 30, i will see drops to 29 that go away when i cap at 34 in exact same conditions (it will drop but to a higher number so it shouldnt have dipped on the 30 cap). The framerate limiter might have a problem.\n\nI hope performance and the technical side can be improved and that you will keep patching this.

There is even a random hologram of a sphinx seemingly pointing to exactly where you need to jump to get in. You can even jump in a hole that gets you directly to the end without solving the puzzle. But you can't interact with the console thingy and you're stuck. So I reloaded the save and jumped in a different place, and solved the puzzle. Still can't interact, and you're stuck. So why make it so easy to get in there? I was positive it had to be on purpose, especially with the sphinx hologram.\n\nAlso, the moving platform in the puzzle seems to be bugged. After I activate it a few times it gets stuck in a random position, so I had to reload my save to try again many times as I was solving it.

No amount of changing the settings helps, maximum or minimum, with any type of sampling, with blur and sharpening disabled or enabled.

- Terminal Thiriel-1: Archived Message, in the hex encoded text, ""let if fall into the wrong hands"" should be ""let it fall into the wrong hands""
- ATHN textadventure: Garden of Hesperides, Knowledge: Self the text ""others must be bear this burden with you."" should be ""others must bear this burden with you.""
- There is a weird wiggling tree in ACT 2 megastructure, by the door where Byron grants you access.  I uploaded two screenshots to show what I was seeing.  I believe I only observed this on one playthrough of that scene, so it might need the player to be at a specific location or view from a certain angle or something.
- In W1, the shadow cast by the player's head appears to be using a different angle of light source than the player's body.  I also uploaded a screenshot of this.
- There were some other goofy visual artifacts especially from changing lighting in some of the elevators, but they weren't as bad as those two I noted above.

So I launch it with win 8 compatibility.\n\nAfter the game launches there's like 20% chance I will get to the main menu (It very often crashes again on epileplsy warning).\n\nIf I manage to get lucky I get to the menu screen, the game often crashes there as well but If I am lucky it will enter this dizzy mode of displaying main menu at a very low stuttery framerate (around 5 fps).\n\nI have to wait in this dizzyness state in the main menu for about a minute or so and then the fps stabilizes at 120. Only then I am allowed to play the game.\n\nHowever the issue does not stop there, when I finally manage to enter the game it is still not working properly. Whenever I enter a puzzle I am forbidden from holding X to reset it as it is guaranteed to crash it.\n\nAlso whenever I change zones there is like 90% chance of the game crashing which is giga annoying since I am on the golden gate puzzles at the moment - which as you know require frequent zone changes.\n\nI am on a brand new desktop PC and all the other games work fine.\nSpecs:\nMB: Gigabyte Z790 GAMING X AX\nRAM: 2 x 16GB ddr5 6000mhz\nCPU: Intel Core i9-14900KF\nGPU: RTX 4070\n\nI checked the integrity of the files many times and everything seems fine.\n\nWhat is also greatly important I feel like.

"The Talos Principle 2","Puzzle","Controller / Video Issues","azimuth","7","Just started up and played for a few minutes, and already running into a few issues. I'm streaming to my TV with the Steam Link app and using an XBox One controller.\n\n1. navigating through menu and changing settings isn't possible, because controller buttons don't do what they say. For example using the shoulder buttons to navigate to different menu tabs doesn't work, so there's no way to access those settings.\n\n2. in-game controller layout is a bit odd. For example 'run' has been moved from left trigger (which has been 'run' in every game for as long as I can remember) to the right shoulder button, which is pretty awkward to use. \n\nI'd love an easy way to go back to the \""classic\"" layout from the first game, which I found much more intuitive. Is there any reason why the old layout wouldn't work? Like are there extra controls that just wouldn't fit in the old scheme?\n\nBeyond the layout, controls are a bit clunky in general. Even a small thing like putting puzzles together seems slow and awkward, compared with the original game where everything just worked. Not sure if that's another controller-specific issue?\n\n3. engine is jittery and glitchy, which is giving me some motion sickness. I have a new-ish computer with decent specs - 13700k, 4070ti, 32GB 5600MHz DDR5, installed on NVMe M.2 SSD - so I expected a better experience in the graphics department - is there an optimization patch in the works? \n\nWhat are recommended settings for a faster, smoother performance if that's all I care about?\n\nIt feels like the original engine was more polished compared to UE5.

4. You can fall into these holes in E3, and you can only get out by restarting.

5. I put the drill on the button, aiming it up - it is pointing down.

6. Textures at the roots of some trees on W2.

7. Here you can jump over the wall on the rock and get to the pedestal without even thinking about solving the puzzle. By the way, when I returned, everything was closed, as if I hadn't solved the puzzle.
https:\/\/steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net\/ugc\/2271565016371559532\/5DE948C37CE4766E0E8B06A795E4062AB747A5E8\/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false 
8. This happened in W2-4. In theory, the grate should have pushed the platform back or forward, but this did not happen. 
https:\/\/steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net\/ugc\/2271565016371568950\/2EDE1A9C516149C254FECADFD6ACC6E6CC6FCCA6\/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false 
9. End of the game, I wanted to approach the arch and build a bridge, but for some reason the force barrier turned on, losing contact with the red emitter. And now there was no way out of here. The only thing that saved me from the softlock was restarting the location.

10. The converter glows green, although it is not connected to anything.

11. Deer on N3 often run in close groups along the same route. It looks even a little creepy. And their stomping can be heard too well - even in underground laboratories. 
https:\/\/steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net\/ugc\/2271565016390504284\/176531CD1C1074A3D5AEF25EC56852F7941B374A\/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false

12. At different locations, devices with rotating parts may stop rotating. I noticed this on N3 and S2. 
13. All trees with light bark in the Megastructure have the same animation (which starts if you hold your gaze on them) swaying in the wind as the plants in the locations outside. It looks strange and even a little creepy. And, to be honest, it doesn’t look very good on ordinary plants either. It would be great if this animation could be disabled. 
14. In S1-8, the hint for jumping from the cube to the platform in front of the pedestal works crookedly. The orange feet sometimes don’t appear at all, sometimes somewhere on the side, usually on the left - next to the red receiver. And because of this, you have to jump at random. 
15. In S3-5, while the platform is moving, the hero can pass through the bars installed along the edges and fall into the water. If you had a connector in your hands at that moment, you will have to restart the location. 
16. If you put a connector between the power barriers in the ""golden"" puzzle at E3, then when you try to take it the hero will take extra steps, as if the device was standing too far away. It is unlikely that you will be able to get the connector on the first try. 
17. In Utopia, you can walk along the cornice protruding above the water directly to the second pedestal. 
••• 
18. Add the ability to enable the background for the compass. Because small compass symbols are generally hard to see, and especially hard to see when there is a bright picture on the screen. 

19. Add a constantly glowing outline around the clone's silhouette. Because the gray silhouette of a clone is sometimes difficult to see, especially among gray walls and at a great distance. 

20. Photos of the images on the Sphinx monuments, which 1K takes, are of rather poor quality, and they are not full screen, but at best 1\/8. It was easier for me to take a photo on a tablet and check it with it. And if it were possible to display a photo on the screen so that you don’t have to go into the interface, that would be absolutely wonderful. 

21. The opportunity to start the race again with the “spirit” of Prometheus. Sometimes, if you lose sight of it, you can get tired of looking for it. I had this happen on N1 and S2 - in the end I went to watch the walkthrough.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/4030221179844775030/","12/01/2024 10:57:56","bug report"

as you wrote in a previous thread to open a new thread for each individual problem because of the different causes, I'll do it right here. I got the problem as mentioned in the title with the following system specs:

Windows 10 22H2 (build 19045.3693)
NVIDIA Quadro M2000M (With Direct X12 installed and the latest Driver version: 546.01)
32 GB RAM
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6820HQ CPU @ 2.70GHz   2.71 GHz

Where is the mistake and why doesn’t it even start? I can start and play every other game I have, this is the only one that doesn’t. I really would appreciate an answer or solution, because Talos 1 ist my favourite game of all time and I really would love to play the new game.

Alle the best,

Puzzle pieces in Archeologic garden of New Jerusalim.

English word ""problem"" has 2 meanings: the ""oh-no situation"" and ""a puzzle to solve"" (usually used for things like kids' math puzzles). 
However in russian these 2 are different words in Russian: straight forward ""проблема"" (Problema) for situation and ""задача"" (zadacha) for puzzle. 
So it should be ""решению задач"" before brackets about Alexandra.

"The Talos Principle 2","Puzzle","3 бага (3 bugs): с лягушками; отображение HUD и ПКМ мыши с устройствами / with frogs; HUD; right-click for devices.","Bohdan36","0","Для всех трех багов записано одно видео (5 склеек коротких видео)[url=https:\/\/youtu.be\/7sWulU_wrZU] Тык [\/url]
или
https:\/\/youtu.be\/7sWulU_wrZU

Не обращайте внимание если есть какие-то помехи в видео, т.к. чтобы записать мне потребовалось понизить качество игры. Также хочу передать большое спасибо за то, что игра доступна через Nvidia GeForce Now. Итак, приступим:

1. Баг с лягушками. на видео фрагмент 0:00 - 1:17
ещё Скриншот - [url=https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/eju1eDr.jpg] Тык [\/url]
Юг. Переход 3. Там где можно увидеть лягушек. Возле них бревно и вот они могут забагаться и не перепрыгнуть.
Другой раз они могут находиться справа от бревна и благополучно перепрыгнут. Но вот и такое бывает, что они застряли) Также если отойти совсем недалеко, то потом может появиться ещё одна лягушка (на видео 00:56), которая тоже не перепрыгнула.
[b]Решение: дать лягушкам перепрыгивать в воду:) Кстати их потом в воде уже не найти:D(( 
Не хотелось бы чтобы при этом бревно убрали.[\/b]

2. Баг HUD, отображения из-за фоторежима. На видео фрагмент 1:18 - 1:57
В настройках игры можно убрать весь HUD экрана, т.е. отображение компаса, целей, спрятать интерфейс. Но при заходе в фоторежим, а потом выходе - остается отображение слева вверху экрана (8 ловушек) и внизу слева. Получается фоторежим сбрасывает настройку отключения HUD. Что ещё может вернуть кроме фоторежима это отображение я не знаю. Убрать отображение можно нажав ESC два раза.
[b] Решение: сделать так, чтобы при выходе с фоторежима не возвращалось отображение на экране при отключении интерфейса\/целей в настройках игры. Также стоит проверить др. варианты, может что-то ещё возвращает.[\/b]

3. Баг - ПКМ мыши (правая кнопка мыши при взаимодействии с устройствами).
на видео фрагмент 1:58 - 2:20
Я надеюсь вы поймете о чем я. Постараюсь сам не запутаться.
ЛКМ - левая кнопка мыши
ПКМ - правая кнопка мыши
Разберем на примере коннектора. И что в итоге не так.

По ходу игры при нажатии ЛКМ берешь предмет. Выбрать объекты - Ещё раз на них попасть мышью - нажать ЛКМ чтобы выбрать и добавить в список активации коннектора. По направлении к земле ставишь предмет нажимая ЛКМ. С ЛКМ работает корректно. Дальше разберем с ПКМ.

Всё дело в том, что когда предмет активен в связях (на видео 2:11), чтобы сохранить связи и передвинуть в другое место ты нажимаешь ПКМ. Дальше чтобы с этими связями поставить предмет вот тут и начинается самое интересное. Ты можешь нажать ЛКМ, а можешь и ПКМ !
То есть я могу использовать правую кнопку мыши чтобы ВЗЯТЬ ПРЕДМЕТ, ЛКМ активировать связи , нажать ПКМ чтобы связи сохранить и поставить ПРЕДМЕТ НАЖАВ ПКМ !  (для отмены связей нужно зажимать ПКМ), а поставить просто НАЖАЛ И ВСЁ.
Также в подтверждение этому в настройках игры (на видео 1:58) и по существу ПОДНЯТЬ и в том числе ПОСТАВИТЬ актуально как для ЛКМ, так и для ПКМ.

В чём проблема?? А в том, что ПОСТАВИТЬ НА ПРАВУЮ КНОПКУ МЫШИ ты можешь, но не всегда. На видео вы слышите щелчки на 2:12 , 2:16 - это значит что не дает поставить. То так происходит не всегда. То есть порой надо нажимать много раз, чтобы в какой-то из них поставился предмет. Ты не меняешь позицию, ты поставить можешь, но ПОСТАВИТЬ БАГАЕТСЯ ПРИ НАЖАТИИ ПРАВОЙ КНОПКИ МЫШИ. ТО СТАВИТСЯ, ТО НАДО КЛАЦАТЬ МНОГО РАЗ, скажем на 5 или 10 поставится. Проблем с мышью нет.

[b]  Решение: Поддержка взятия объектов через ПРАВУЮ КНОПКУ мыши есть и ПРЕДМЕТЫ  СТАВЯТСЯ ЧЕРЕЗ ПРАВУЮ КНОПКУ МЫШИ ТОЖЕ.  Но нужна полная поддержка ПРАВОЙ КНОПКИ МЫШИ чтобы ставились с первого раза и не возникали такие щелчки.[\/b]","ru","translation failed","https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/5774239504126990930/","12/01/2024 10:58:59","bug report"

I am playing on North 3 and starting solving puzzle 8, but then got stuck and left to solve the second lost puzzle. When I reentered puzzle 8, I had to quit the game. When I restarted the game, the puzzle 8 blue gates are now deactivated and the golden gate didnt recognize that I successfully solved the most recent lost puzzle (I have solved 12 LPs, but only 11 blue lights are active on the gate). Is this a bug? It seems to be, as others have recently complained about these gates being deactivated.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/835960/discussions/1/5774239174010423964/","12/01/2024 10:59:20","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","PINNED:FAQ: Fullscreen, Borderless, Adaptive Sync, Microstutter","The Invisibl","1","[b]This FAQ applies to the Windows version only![\/b]\n\n[b]Fullscreen Modes[\/b]\n\nThere were some small changes in the Jan 8 2018 update to make fullscreen play as nice as possible by default. Here I'll explain what the differences are, and how to tweak it if you want. When you select fullscreen in the launcher, the implementation you get depends on the version of Windows you have.\n\nOn any version of Windows 7, 8, or 10 [i]before[\/i] the recent Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, fullscreen mode will default to native fullscreen.\n\nOn the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and after, fullscreen mode will default to borderless windowed due to native fullscreen giving strange minimizing, alt-enter, and alt-tab behaviour on some systems.\n\nIf you don't know what version of Windows you're on, we write it out to the log file ([url=http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/210970\/discussions\/3\/458606877334686933\/]here's[\/url] how to find the log file). About 15 lines down, you'll see something like [i]\""OS: Windows 10, PlatformId 2, Version 10.0, Build 15063\""[\/i]. The Fall Creator's update is Windows 10 build 16299.\n\nThere's a third option for fullscreen, \""Flip Sequential\"", that was introduced with Windows 8 for Windows Store apps. We never set it by default, but you can force it on if you like (see below). It forces Vsync on and may have other issues - we haven't done any rigorous testing on it because native and borderless windowed cover most people's requirements.\n\n\n[b]Manually Forcing a Fullscreen Mode[\/b]\n\nYou can manually force a fullscreen mode through the Local.variables file:\n\nIn Library in the steam client, right click on The Witness and go to: \nProperties -> LOCAL FILES -> BROWSE LOCAL FILES...\nGo in into the \""data\"" folder and open [b]Local.variables[\/b] in a text editor.\nYou should see this section near the bottom:\n[code]\n:\/display\nvsync true\n[\/code]\nAdd this extra line underneath \""vsync true\"" :\n[code]\nfullscreen_mode 0\n[\/code]\nThe number after \""fullscreen_mode\"" determines what you get:\n[list]\n[*] 0 is Native Fullscreen\n[*] 1 is Borderless Windowed\n[*] 2 is Flip Sequential\n[*] ...anything else is invalid\n[\/list]\nIf you request a mode not available on your version of Windows, it'll force something that is. You can check if it worked by looking in the log file just under the Windows version information. You'll see a line like \""D3D11: fullscreen_mode: requested 0, got 0\""\n\n\n[b]G-SYNC[\/b]\n\nThe default G-SYNC setting is to be enabled for fullscreen only. [i]Despite that, G-SYNC seems to work fine on borderless windowed in a lot of cases anyway[\/i].\n\nHowever. if you have G-SYNC and it's not working for you (but working fine for other games), there are a couple of things to try:\n[olist]\n[*]Make sure you have V-Sync option turned [i]off[\/i] in The Witness launcher and\/or pause menu settings.\n[*]It might be due to borderless windowed not playing nice with G-SYNC's fullscreen setting. You can change this in NVIDA Control Panel -> Display -> Setup G-SYNC -> enable G-SYNC for windowed and fullscreen mode.\n\nI've seen various postings online with reports of this setting causing low frame rates and\/or mouse-lag artifacts with certain GPU driver versions and\/or certain Windows 10 updates. We haven't been able to reproduce any of these issues but it's something to be aware of.\n\nIf the setting causes problems for you, you could also make it apply only to The Witness by making a game-specific profile with a tool like [url=https:\/\/forums.geforce.com\/default\/topic\/926916\/3d-vision\/nvidia-inspector-gt-gt-gt-new-2-1-3-10-\/post\/5208633\/#5208633]Nvidia Profile Inspector[\/url]\n[\/olist]\n\n\n[b]V-Sync Options[\/b]\n\n[i]This is old information and I doubt many people will need to make this change, but I kept it here for completeness:[\/i]\n\nAs of the 4\/4\/2016 update, we changed our default vsync implementation for Nvidia and AMD GPUs. In all our tests with latest drivers at the time this was much smoother, and plays nicer with adaptive sync methods to reduce microstutter. This did NOT affect Intel GPUs at all.\n\nThat said, if you find it was better for you before the update:\n[olist]\n[*]Make sure you have the latest drivers. Get them direct from Nvidia\/AMD's websites.\n[*]If it's still no good, you can switch back to the old method:\nIn Library in the steam client, right click on The Witness and go to: \nProperties -> LOCAL FILES -> BROWSE LOCAL FILES...\nGo in into the \""data\"" folder and open [b]Local.variables[\/b] in a text editor.\nYou should see this section near the bottom:\n[code]\n:\/display\nvsync true\n[\/code]\nAdd this extra line underneath \""vsync true\"" :\n[code]\nvsync_method 1\n[\/code]\n[\/olist]\n\n\n\n\n\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/371918937276000741/","12/01/2024 10:59:52","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","I think it's a bug?","ViDeez","0","So I reinstalled the game thinking it would solve it... but nothing.\n\nI got into the huge mountain thing, where all the lasers go. Solved the puzzle and went down the stairs to the bottomless hall where you need to draw a path to walk on to solve riddles on the wall. I'm currently trying to solve those warped Riddles with the orange monitors. I am on the 3rd Riddle out of 7, where the riddle is cut into 4 separate pieces, but i don't seem to be able to pull out the line. It's the last riddle sequence I need to open the long, orange, rectangular door to continue my way into the mountain.\n\nIs it locked for some unclear reason? Do I first have to lock\/solve something else? Or is it really just a bug?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/3959288052805118805/","12/01/2024 10:59:56","bug report"

I get a generic \""The Witness is corrupted\"" message. This started when I upgraded to the beta, and the program was running fine on Monterey. I am also on a new M1 machine, as that may be relevant.\n\nI know this is probably too early in the lifecycle of this OS, but wanted to see if you were aware of any issues and if there is anything I can do to assist in finding a resolution.\n\nThanks!","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/4778901811098039828/","12/01/2024 10:59:58","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Walking bug (win 11) the game walks by itself","VHenrik","1","Hi! \nI have an issue where sometimes my character just keeps walking in one direction. So, for example, I'm pressing W, and then D too, and then poof, when I release my fingers it just keeps going either forward, or right. Sometimes double-tapping one of the WASD is enough to make it get stuck into a certain direction, and the same goes for pressing shift, it is exactly like it thinks that I'm still pressing the button, because when I press it again (the button which it thinks is stuck), it stops. \nI have win11 on my PC, but on my laptop I have win10, and I did not experience anything there, with the same keyboard. Then, I tried running the game in older windows compatibility mode, but that didn't do the trick. I also tried reinstalling and verifying the game, still nothing. Running as administrator and all that. \nI did not find anything online, and all the other games are just fine. I hope someone has some tricks for it, thank you in advance!\n\nFound another discussion about the same issue: \nhttps:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/210970\/discussions\/3\/2282708683254356114\/\n\nOh,

In my game i just see a flat unchanging texture with the puzzle on from all distances angles and perspectives, it literally looks like a ships wheel no matter what, this is very frustrating and i cant understand it, screenshots seem to show a glossy reflective texture to the panels.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Can't use the scroll wheel to zoom","miconazole","2","So I got a new mouse and can't zoom with the scroll wheel anymore (and before you ask, yes, the scroll wheel does work in other programs). It's not exactly essential to playing the game but I kinda miss the ability to look a bit closer at things.

One user has confirmed that rolling back to an earlier driver fixed the problem.\n\nWe're talking to Nvidia about this, I'll update this thread if\/when we hear anything. \n\nIn the meantime, if you encounter this bug, please let us know in a comment here, and include two things:\n1. Anything \""non-default\"" about your setup, such as changes to the 3D settings in the Nvidia Control Panel, as that might help us reproduce it locally.\n2. Were you previously running the game ok on a previous driver? (and if so, which one)\n\nNote that Nvidia have already issued one hotfix for this driver (link below) for problems when using their Image Sharpening feature, so if you have that setting enabled, it's worth a try. Maybe it's worth a try even if you don't... https:\/\/www.nvidia.com\/en-us\/geforce\/forums\/game-ready-drivers\/13\/350672\/announcing-geforce-hotfix-driver-version-44578-rel\/","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/2268067547759255705/","12/01/2024 11:02:29","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Question about system requirements","RocketSword","0","Hi everyone,
so I have the thought of maybe buying this game. This is not a technical problem but I thought it may fit in this forum because my question is about the technical side of the game. My Pc fulfills the requirements on recommended except for the graphics card, since mine is an GTX 650 1 GB, so I wanted to ask what framerate will I be able to get? And which graphic settings can I achieve under an smooth framerate, if that's possible? (low, medium, high?)
Thanks in advance ːsteamhappyː","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/2147595624107338429/","12/01/2024 11:02:30","bug report"

Now every time I try to start up the game it instantly crashes. I restarted my computer, verified the game files, and uninstalled\/reinstalled the game - nothing's worked so far.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","How to import saves from MacOS to Windows?","Still Alive","4","So I have been playing \""The Witness\"" on my MacBook Pro 2013 up to this moment. Recently, I have bought myself a laptop shipped with Windows and I wanted to continue my current playthrough on that laptop, hoping that my saves from Mac will sync using Steam Cloud Sync. But they didn't, it seems, that Windows client maintains its saves on separate Steam Cloud server and MacOS client maintains its saves on a separate one too so the saves from different systems don't overlap. But that's exactly what I want to do! I want to import my saves from MacBook to my windows operating laptop. Is there any way to do just that?!

I read that increasing the field of view can help to alleviate that. On the Windows version at least, this seems to be possible by changing the fov_vertical setting in the misc section of Local.variables.\n\nI have tried adding this setting to my Local.variables file, but this doesn't seem to have any effect. Adding \""show_config_dialog false\"" does hide the configuration window when starting the game, so I am editing the correct file.\n\nI'm running The Witness from the Epic games store.

Nas configurações de video alterei a resolução ou lá o que é de 16\/9 para 4\/3 ou outra qualquer que lá tem.

Agora sempre que tento iniciar o jogo aparece ""Ocorreu um erro ao actualiciar o CS: GO (app em execução). Consulta o site do support steam para mais info"".

Já consultei e diz que tem a ver com a actualização das drives do Direct X mas tenho a mais recente. Caso contrario alterar o Launch setup para o que lá tem. Nada funcionou.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","No Sound","TheSlaughterCat","5","I recently got this game and after two hours of playing it, I realized there was actually supposed to be sound to it. I'm unable to get sound, or even any background music from the game, and I have tried multiple pairs of headsets as well as not using any headset at all. I was also unable to find any sort of sound settings for it. Reinstalling the game also didn't seem to do any good.\n Any help would be appreciated, thanks!\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/2534848209927737911/","12/01/2024 11:02:50","bug report"
"Superliminal","Puzzle","Symmetry puzzles are invisible","nore","3","First, thank you for making such a great game!\nI am playing The Witness on Linux using Steam Play, and it works well. However, I just noticed that the symmetry puzzles in the glass factory, for instance, are completely invisible (see [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1621716053]screenshot[\/url]). This is unfortunately game-breaking since it makes it impossible to solve those puzzles...\n\nI'm aware that the game is unlikely to be updated further, so, just wanted to know if there is anything I can do about that.\n\nlog.txt below:\n---\n[code]\nThe Witness -

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Graphical Issues after Dec 20 2017 Update","segmentation fault","9","Since the December 20, 2017 update, I have noticed some graphical glitches on my machine (windows 10) that were not there previously. Following are my explanations and some screenshots of the issues.

-----------------------------------

The first thing is a problem with water textures that make the water extremely over bright when viewing the polys from certain angles. This likely effects all water but it is most noticeable on water in dark places. 
Here are a few examples:

http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584647
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584876

-----------------------------------

The next graphical issue has to do with shadows and lighting.
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584895

Notice the lack of shadows inside of this building:
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584960
The stone wall should be shaded by the structure but is still being lit by the sun. As you walk closer to the building the shadows appear. 

It is a little harder to express precisely what is going on in static screenshots as the effect is more pronounced when the player is moving around. I am not really set up to capture video so here are several screenshot sequences that I hope will get the point across.

Here I take a few steps forward, take a screenshot, and so on...

Later I noticed that moving the camera also has an effect on this lighting problem, not just player position.
In this sequence I stand still and move the mouse, panning the camera to the right:

These lighting issues seem to be exclusive to above ground locations, that is, locations that are in contact with sunlight, but I could be wrong about that. (I have not looked at all areas of the game, nor have I attempted interacting with dynamic objects underground that would effect shadows)

-----------------------------------

There may be other subtle issues that I am not seeing, or maybe after looking for so long I am seeing things that look weird that are suppose to be that way. I can’t really tell if the puzzle panels are fine or not. Part of me thinks something is off, but I can’t put my finger on it. 
Here is a close up and distance view.

\/\/does the glow around the panels from a distance seem a bit strong? I don’t know.


Anyway, I hope this helps. If you need anything more from me feel free to ask.
My computer probably falls on the low end of the requirements so I understand if this is not high priority.  This game has had a lasting impact on me, and is one of my favorites. Please accept a virtual high five to all of The Witness team.

error : Swap chain creation failed.

I'm pretty sure that in [i]every[\/i] crash log, the ""error : The D3D11 device in use has been removed. Reason: HUNG"" line is there. Not informed enough to know what that means in terms of troubleshooting. 

I've tried the following:
[list]
[*] Turning on SLI in my Nvidia settings, launching
[*] Turning it back off, launching
[*] Turning all my Nvidia settings to low, launching
[*] Turning them back to default, launching
[*] Reinstalling the game
[*] Running the ""future"" beta
[*] Updating my drivers through Geforce Experience and through the official Nvidia site
[*] Running as admin both the x64 exe and the non-x64 exe
[*] Picking all graphics levels, low lasts the shortest amount of time while high lasts the longest (~3 mins)
[*] Vsync on\/off
[*] Starting in windowed\/unwindowed, staying within each, and switching after starting with each
[*] Starting in lowered resolution
[*] Over\/underclocking with afterburner (this was when I first tried to get it to work, around half a year ago, so I don't remember the specifics. I could try again if it'd be helpful)
[\/list]

And none of the above had any effect whatsoever. I'm at the point where I'm hunting for a PS4 key, but the only option is paying another $40 bucks that I don't have right now, because all the cheaper key websites have unfortunately run out of them.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even if it's ""your GPU\/CPU\/Something else cannot handle this game,"" I'd be glad to know that's the problem.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/1733212454825485116/","12/01/2024 11:02:57","bug report"

However in addition, their is a constant flickering of anything in a standard shadow as opposed to the shadow which follows the character, making it difficult to play\n\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/fE0aT110LTQ\n\nSpecs:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2013)\nProcessor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5\nMemory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB\nOS: Version 10.13 Beta (17A291m)\n(While I am running a fairly low end cpu for gaming, this lies well within the minimum specs)\nNote: I am running Metal 2, which should only increase performance beyond standard Metal.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/1471968797466185073/","12/01/2024 11:03:03","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Unable to set up display device","JeeRik","10","Hello,\nI have a problem with my game. The notebook I am running is below the game requirements (namely GPU), but when I ran it for the first time, it ran without any problems (given that I do not consider low graphics quality a problem). After I played for some 4 hours and closed the game, I was not able to start the game since.\nThe error I get is \""Fatal error: Unable to set up display device\"". It occurs right after I submit the initial configuration. I tried everything I figured out might help: Went through all combinations of options in the start menu (even tried higher graphics, just in case). I tried reinstall. Tried system reboot. Even the 32bit loader. Only thing I did not try is to delete the save files, as I could not find them.\nHow can I restore the state when the game ran?\n\nFirst launch log (excluding the middle, as it corresponds to a 4 hour

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Good performance on a Mac Pro (Mid 2010) with a GTX 970 from EVGA","star-affinity","2","I thought I'd share some postitive feedback (for a change?) and that is how well the game performs for me now in MacOS (10.13.3) with the Nvidia Web Drivers (387.10.10.10.25.156). There's the occationaly tiny framerate ”hickup”, but nothing major. When the game was released I had some noticable frame rate drops when viewing certain areas of the game, but whatever the reason is, that seem to be gone. Think it might has been the first update (after release) that you did for the Witness, becase I remember there was a positive change already back when I tried that.


Anyway, I'm happy – running the game at 1920 x 1200, with ”High” on all settings and 4x MSAA. :)","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/1700541698690799092/","12/01/2024 11:03:30","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Landscape doesn't load?","lenewj","15","Hello,\n\nI downloaded The Witness tonight, and was really excited to play it. I've seen some videos and images of it and it looks beautiful. The only problem is that when I started the game, the initial gaming screen I got was almost like I am above the clouds, between the sun and.....well, I guess clouds. I can hear myself walk, and at one point I was asked to click the left mouse button, but after that, nothing. I can spin around and the sun moves in time with how I move, but there are absolutely no landscapes or walls or anything to be seen. I have no idea if I'm doing something wrong, or if the game just is not loading as it should...\nI'm playing on an iMac with OSX El Capitan 10.11.6, 4 GHz, i7..

I can click on it in the task bar no problem. However, the audio just disappears and there is a weird white line in the pause\/escape menu. See here: http:\/\/prntscr.com\/htiuwj\n\nI have restarted Steam, my computer, disabled audio drivers one by one, change audio to stereo... everything I've been able to find on the internet regarding audio issues. I have uninstalled the game, reinstalled it on different drives, etc. However, I have no idea what the white line means (it doesn't show up in videos\/screenshots online and I haven't seen it before this started happening)\n\nDid I somehow press a mute key somewhere? I'm so lost.

At first I played with medium settings and thought the framerate was bad, but later when I got to different areas I had to change graphics settings to low. Now that I've gotten into this village-like area, the game often drops to around1-2fps, and I also get these 5-second pauses where the sound also cuts out.\n\nFrom this forum it seems like the game actually works ok on some Apple laptops, so I'm sure something's wrong. I have tried many different graphics setting combinations, and also changing the desktop resolution. I would have changed to playing on a PC long ago, only apparently I'll have to start a new game. :(\n\nHere's a log file:\n\n[code]\nThe Witness - OSX - Final\nVersion 1.050M\nBuilt 2017\/02\/17

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Awful stuttering on RX580 -  what can I do ?","Pgeon","3","Hello everybody.\n\nFirst, I played the Whitness about an hour until now and I think it is AMAZING. The puzzles were intuitive and the overall atmosphere is great.\n\nHowever, my game stutters awfully on my new RX580. I shouldn't be hardware related since I actually changend my card one week ago for a new one because I always get 100% fb-usage ( thats still the case btw). Other games run just finde and it is just a handful including The Whitness and Overwatch which let me to the conclusion that something in the programming of these games colludes with the 100% fb-usage I have on my card (overall usage is fine).\n\nSo what could I do about in in the settings of this particular game ? I own a 1440p monitor so setting the settings on low or mid really makes the game look awful and mushy. Any other advices ?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/2579854400745211192/","12/01/2024 11:03:45","bug report"

When a game runs in Vertical Sync in Full Screen it shows the FPS that your monitor can support, mine is 75Hz so Full Screen Games in Vertical Sync give me 75FPS, but this game gives me 60FPS.

I click play, the game title in my library changes to \""Running\"" for a second and then changes back. No black box saying the game is launching, nothing. Tried restarting Steam client as suggested in another thread, no dice. Please help.\n\nRadeon R9 270, i7, Windows 7. Thanks\n\nEDIT: So I did some digging and found out there was a missing redist. So i installed it (C++ 2013) and now I can launch the game from outside Steam in the game folder but not from Steam. I even tried reinstalling. It might not seem like a big deal to some because I can technically play the game but I picked the Steam copy rather than the DRM-Free copy for a reason so I hope someone can be of assistance.\n\nThanks again.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/1319961618829906543/","12/01/2024 11:04:07","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Discrete GPU: Worked initially then ""No suitable display adapter found""","strank","3","Hi all\n\nI'm on a Surface Book, so a laptop with an integrated and a discrete GPU, the latter being definitely strong enough for the game's requirements. The Witness ran perfectly two hours ago, now it doesn't start with \""No suitable display adapter found\"".\n\nThere was no change in the software setup in these two hours. What changed is that, initially, when I first started the game, I had a second monitor attached. When it failed to start now, that monitor was not attached. Trying to trick the device creation code by now attaching (another) external monitor does not lead to a different result - it still fails with the same error message. As you can see in the log files below, the game does see the dGPU.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","How to Disable Controller?","Flexico","5","This may sound like a silly thing to ask, but is there a way to make The Witness disregard the controller input? When using a controller to play PC games, I usually use a program called Joy2key to map the controller buttons and joysticks to keyboard buttons and mouse actions. However, The Witness also recognizes the controller directly, but uses a different control scheme than I set up, so I'm forced to disable Joy2key and use the default controls. Is there a way to make the game ignore the controller, or else at least change the controls?\n\nI'm using Windows 7 and a PS3 controller, with the Xbox controller driver.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/135512305402986111/","12/01/2024 11:04:13","bug report"

Unfortunately, regardless of what I change, whether it's shadows from high to low or polygon quality from low to high, it does nothing and the game itself only pays attention to the graphics preset on the main launcher menu. I'd be fine with it if the shadows didn't look like blocks on medium or low presets. Any ideas to fix this?\n\nThanks for any and all feedback.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/135512931353981595/","12/01/2024 11:04:14","bug report"
"Superliminal","Puzzle","Manually increase shadow quality?","BaronVonChickenpants","2","Hi there, \n\nI relaunched the game for the first time in ages today. Must be the first time I've seen the graphics launcher.... \n\nAnyway, everything is stuck on low quality, presumably because my system is quite old. \n\nI remember it looking better so wondered if I could manually increase the quality somehow, especially the shadows? \n\nCan I still tinker in the config files even though the launcher settings are all locked on low?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/135512625253141476/","12/01/2024 11:04:14","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Mac version: Game sometimes doesn't register that lines are complete","Pesky","0","Mac version on very fast Mac, with a trackpad, current version of macOS.\n\nAbout 1 time in 15, the game is not registering that I have drawn the entire line.  It acts as if I lifted off a pixel before the line was complete.  Once I was sure I wasn't getting the wrong solution I slowed down and took a look.  When a line is complete the game is meant to signal it by flashing the line colour a little.  Sometimes that doesn't happen.  I have to hold the button down for an extra second or two to make the line flash.  Happens equially on puzzle lines and environmental lines.\n\nI'm comparing touch-and-feel experience with the Windows version of the game, running under Windows 10 on the same computer (Bbot Camp on another partition).  With the Windows version I can draw the line and lift off immediately and it works every time.  With the Mac version this sometimes doesn't work, and to make sure the game thinks the line is complete I have to hold down the button for a couple of seconds.\n\n----------\n\nSpecs: MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016), 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7, Radeon Pro 460 4096 MB\nVery recent (nudge nudge wink wink) version of the OS","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/135512291865473248/","12/01/2024 11:04:17","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Game freezing at loading screen","Coquinho","0","Hi,\nI am enjoying the game so far, but after some days after the installation the game won't start properly.\n\nNow, when I try to run the game, it keep stuck in the loading screen (that black screen with the symbols). In order to make the the game to work I have to try to run it dozens of times, in Window mode and press CTRL + Enter to enter Full Screen. I have tried with different quality settings, but I was not able to find a workaround. After several tries, the game eventually loads then I can run it normally, but it's really annoying. Sometimes I keep trying for 30 minutes :(\n\nLog:\n\nThe Witness - x64 - D3D11 - Final\nVersion 0.964M\nBuilt 2016\/08\/03 10:58:32 from 134851\nArgs: \nInit app:\n    Init core:\n        Init asset loader:\n            Using unbundled processed asset list\n            36.85 ms elapsed\n        40.46 ms elapsed\n    Init render:\n        OS: Windows 7, PlatformId 2, Version 6.1, Build 7601\n        D3D11: Enumerating adapters:\n            -

The puzzles are tricky, but spending time in the world helps to grok them. Really scratches that itch.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Problems with Xbox Controller(and probably others)","MASTAN","2","1. Setup window that appears before starting game requires mouse\/keyboard. This breaks experience when starting game from Steam's Big Picture Mode with gamepad. Enable joystick control there. I know this window can be disabled in some config file, but that is kinda hack and not a solution for not tech savvy people(imagine grandma doing that!)\n2. If controller was not plugged in before starting game then it won't work.\n3. Turning speed is too slow.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Freezing issues","Floyd","5","I'm having freezing issues in some places of the island. The game ran perfectly at the beginning (castle, orchard, peninsula, desert...) and around the island near the shores, but it has freezes and stuttering towards the center. (Japanese temple, meadow, orange tree forest, the town...)\n\nI tested different graphic settings to see if it was of any help but, the game keeps stuttering the same way in given areas. I also emptied the game cache and reset the global settings in the Nvidia Control Panel as advised in another thread, but it didn't make any change.\n\nI should also mention that my computer is running very slow for a little while each time I leave the game after experiencing the freezing\/stuttering.\n\nIt's a bit gamebreaking and I would definitly appreciate if it could be solved. \n\n\n-> Here are my specs.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Question about error-checking (Spoilers)","Catgirl Jessica","1","I was hoping a dev could shine some light on a mysterious aspect of the game's error-checking feature. In the Marsh, the blue outline shapes are used to cancel out yellow shapes and they seem to follow a strict logical rule: [i]Blue outline shapes remove the shape indicated by the outlined shape from the solution of yellow squares, so long as they are grouped together in the same region.[\/i] \n\nThis rule seems to hold true all of the time, however after doing some testing there appears to be an exception to the rule: [i]Should blue outline shapes reduce the number yellow squares to zero, then the region is free of the shape rules so long as the icons remain grouped appropriately.[\/i] Examples of this: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kHss7QS.png and http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UAaFi5y.png Notice how the error-checking feature doesn't blink the blue outline shape and its yellow shape partner, even though they don't have the same shape and in the first case neither is slanted. However this exception only comes up when error-checking an invalid solution and it can't lead to a valid solution.\n\nSo my question is, why does the above occur?\n\n1. The error-checking feature is faulty and fails to show an error, or doesn't check the full panel?\n2. The blue outline shape algorithm has an unintentional exception and in order to get around this, the puzzles were designed so it could never be used?\n3. The exception is intentional but was never utilized?\n4. Some other reason?\n\nSee Reddit thread for our discussion on this topic: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheWitness\/comments\/5s5tnz\/swamp_4_blue_squares_why_does_this_not_work_but\/ddctx3t\/\n\nThanks for any feedback, as this is something that I've been wondering about for a while.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/135508292191980454/","12/01/2024 11:04:28","bug report"
"Superliminal","Puzzle","Fatal Error: No suitable display adapter found","jalbenphillips","4","I used to be happily playing The Witness on a laptop with Intel HD graphics, and at medium quality it actually ran fairly well, although stuttering a lot in complex environments.\n\nRecently I picked up a new laptop with \""switchable\"" graphics: it's an AMD A10 processor with integrated Radeon HD 8610G, plus a discrete Radeon R7 M260 and 2 GB video RAM.  The drivers are the latest AMD offers, and it's running on Windows 10 64-bit.\n\nStarting The Witness gives me an error pop-up: \""Fatal Error - No suitable display adapter found\"".  I checked the log file, and \""D3D11\"" seems to only detect the integrated HD 8610G plus some \""Microsoft Basic Render Driver\"", but not the R7 adapter.  But \""AGS\"" detects the R7.\n\nThe Radeon settings are weird, but I've set it to \""high performance\"" (as opposed to \""power saving\"") for the witness_d3d11.exe and witness64_d3d11.exe applications, so it should be using the R7 for those.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Missing structures","Kitty","4","I've been having problems with Witness - it keeps forgetting to draw things. Big things - like buildings, or hills. Quitting and restarting solves the problem until I move to a new location, and then most of the new place is missing. (At the very start, the control panel next to the glittering wall was missing - took ages to figure that out)\n\nI'm guessing this is because this isn't the latest machine - I've done the \/3GB thing, hidden the concurrent resource creation warning, and the logfile is a train-wreck! I've tried fiddling with all the options, but can't find one to fix this. Oddly, the game seems smooth and plays fine. Any suggestions?\n\nStart of Logfile attached - it gets very repetitive and goes on for 800kb...\n\nAny ideas? Even if its just how to force a reload without restarting the game?\n\n[code]\nThe Witness - Win32 - D3D11 - Final\nVersion 0.964M\nBuilt 2016\/08\/03 10:59:41 from 134851\nArgs: -skip_concurrent_resource_creation_check \nInit app:\n    Init core:\n        Init asset loader:\n            Using unbundled processed asset list\n            40.73 ms elapsed\n        43.94 ms elapsed\n    Init render:\n        OS: Windows 10, PlatformId 2, Version 10.0, Build 14393\n        D3D11: Enumerating adapters:\n            -

The gpu heats up but not beyond limits, just got an extra fan base for my laptop too. I am pulling my hair out because I want to be able to play this game unhindered by hw ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Any thoughts?

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Heavy stuttering while moving around the world","Nicolas","8","When I move around the game freezes periodically... Like large fractions of a second.

Tell me if there's anything I can do to help narrow down the root cause of this performance problem.\n\nBy the way, I don't think this happened when I played the game at its original release.

If not, I'd suggest waiting as we'll push the update to the main branch after a few days anyway (and swapping to a beta is a big download)\n\nTo swap to the future beta:\n[list]\n[*]Close The Witness\n[*]In Library in the steam client, right click on The Witness and go to: \n[*]Properties -> BETAS\n[*]Select \""future -\"" from the dropdown\n[*]There's no access code, it should start downloading straight away\n[\/list]\n\n[b]WARNING:[\/b] \nMoving to this new version is a one-way trip for your savegames, so if you do it, I'd suggest backing them up by making a copy of your save folder.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Game crashes 5 to 30 minutes into session","bionicOnion","4","Every time that I've run The Witness, it has frozen--most of the time crashing my entire system along with it. Sometimes the system will simply hang, other times it will crash to a blue screen; unfortunately, I didn't have enough foresight to actually copy down the error codes. I do recall, however, that one of the recurring issues related to a memory paging error (something to the effect of paging an unpaged area, but my recollection is foggy) and that another common one relates to a watchdog violation. If I end up encountering another blue screen error, I'll note the error code and add it to this.\n\nMy most recent log file is as follows (this is from running the game immediately after validating the files which still resulted in a system-freezing crash):\n\nThe Witness -

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Height problems in VR, 'comfort mode' question.","Diziet Embless Sma","2","I just bought the game, as it's been on my Wishlist for a while and now with a Rift it seemed like a good time to dive in.\n\nI have two questions though and I hope this is the right place to ask.\n\n1) The player 'height' or floor height seems wrong.  I'm about half as tall as I should be and have to look up all the puzzles like the slightly awed child I am! :D I've been through the Steam VR seated setup a few times recalibrating it but it doesn't seem to change the height, regardless of whether I am sat or not.\n\n2) Is there a way to turn off comfort mode via some ini flag?  I find the fact you turn in set increments quite disorientating.  \n\nEither way great game so far, and I hope there's some plans afoot to allow a little more configuration of the VR experience even if never officialyl supported and\/or made available via ini tweaks.  I for one would love VR + mouse\/key controls.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/358415738202534606/","12/01/2024 11:05:17","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Problems with AMD Radeon HD 6990","Marian","3","I just stared playing and this game is awesome!\n\nThere just seems to be a problem with my graphics card. It has a very loud fan and in this game, the fan doesn't turn on at all.\nAt lowest settings, I'm getting 20-30fps while standing and 15fps while moving.\nIn Rocket League, I'm getting 60fps throughout with highest settings. I don't own very graphically demanding games otherwise, so my hardware might not be up to it, but it still seems weird.\n\nI made sure that all settings in the Catalyst Control Center are set to default (there aren't many though).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLog:\n[code]The Witness - x64 - D3D11 - Final\nVersion 0.944M\nBuilt 2016\/01\/23 14:35:20 from 131468\nUser: Marian on Machine: LENA-PC\nInit app:\n    Init core:\n        Init asset loader:\n            Using unbundled processed asset list\n            123.73 ms elapsed\n        228.14 ms elapsed\n    Init render:\n        D3D11: Found 1 adapter outputs.\n        D3D11: SDK version 7\n        D3D11: Adapter = 'AMD Radeon HD 6990'\n        D3D11: Output device = '\\\\.\\DISPLAY1'\n        D3D11: VendorId = 0x1002 (AMD)\n        Render_Profile: profile_to_set is -2\n        WIN: Refresh rate = 60.00 Hz (0.02 s)\n        D3D11: Created D3D11 device with feature level 11.0\n        win32_create_window(in_windowed_mode = false)\n        D3D11: hwnd is 0005061a\n        WM_DISPLAYCHANGE 1920 1080\n            GetClientRect: 0 0 - 1920 1080\n        D3D11: Dedicated Video Memory = 4142024.00 MB\n        D3D11: Dedicated System Memory =   0.00 MB\n        D3D11: Shared System Memory = 1834076.00 MB\n        D3D11: concurrent_resource_creation = true\n        D3D11: max_texture_size = 16384\n        D3D11: max_texture_buffer_size = 16384\n        Render extents = 1920 x 1080\n        5.03 s elapsed\n    Minimal initialization:\n        Set up shaders:\n            cache file operations (shaders):\n                1.57 s elapsed\n            Set up shader flags:\n                3.32 s elapsed\n            4.93 s elapsed\n        5.08 s elapsed\n    WM_DISPLAYCHANGE 1920 1080\n        GetClientRect: 0 0 - 1920 1080\n    Init catalogs:\n        1.32 s elapsed\n    Load global assets:\n        1.56 s elapsed\n    Init shared resources:\n        Allocated 512 KB for translucent vertex buffer.\n        Allocated 128 KB for translucent index buffer.\n        Loading footsteps.\n        1.26 s elapsed\n    Init game:\n        CPU clock frequency: 3.010 GHz\n        GPU clock frequency: 0.027 GHz\n        validated foam buffer settings: buffer 1 (w\/2.0, h\/2.0), decals 1, blur quality 2\n        Load asset dependencies:\n            477.29 ms elapsed\n        Load common assets (package):\n            6.07 s elapsed\n        Load shared assets (package):\n            12.52 s elapsed\n        Init level:\n            Loading processed entities.\n                153.62 ms elapsed\n            Lightmap asset failed to load: 'save_249756_00'\n            Process queries\n                40.99 ms elapsed\n            Loaded 48691 entities.\n              - 249 cluster entities.\n            Load campaign:\n                Process queries\n                    0.16 ms elapsed\n                61.36 ms elapsed\n            world bounding box (-389.959, -372.600, -225.943) to (365.146, 352.906, 549.984) \n            Game_Resource_Manager::on_post_load:\n                Streaming entities:\n                    249 clusters\n                   7540 unclustered entities\n                   1122 dynamic\n                30.53 ms elapsed\n            1.07 s elapsed\n        Warm up streaming data:\n            Lightmap asset failed to load: 'save_951_00'\n            Lightmap asset failed to load: 'save_246052_00'\n            Lightmap asset failed to load: 'save_246050_00'\n            Lightmap asset failed to load: 'save_249398_00'\n            Lightmap asset failed to load: 'save_246051_00'\n            Lightmap asset failed to load: 'save_186031_00'[\/code]\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/458606877335203808/","12/01/2024 11:05:19","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Freezes when playing audio from different sources","TSDragoncar","4","Whenever I play the Witness and play any sort of audio from an external source (for example, music or discord) my PC completely freezes.  This wasn't a problem when I played the Witness at launch.  The only thing I have changed since then is that I have started running my headphones through a USB amplifier. Could this be the problem or is something else causing this issue?\n\nEDIT: I should have also said that this does not happen with any other game.\n\nEDIT 2: I tried using speakers instead of my headphones so the problem is definitely something that has changed with the Witness or some drivers somewhere.\n\n[b]EDIT 3: The game has started crashing within a minute of starting it even without any audio playing. is there any way to roll back to previous versions?\t[\/b]\n\nEDIT 4: I tried disabling SLI, clean installing graphics drivers with DDU, resinstalling the game.

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Lower graphics below their current minimum levels?","Toasty","11","I've been playing this game for the past week and loving it, but I'm getting to the point where I can no longer ignore the huge dives in performance I experience around some areas of the game. Places like the town, the tetris marsh, and the temple with the cross-hatch puzzles slow down to near unplayable levels, sometimes threatening to crash. I'm playing with the lowest graphics settings, and supposedly I meet the minimum specs, but with the performance I'm getting, you'd think I was trying to run the game on an Easy Bake Oven.\n\nI've noticed that the problem is especially bad around areas with water effects (like the waterfalls) and visually busy areas (the forests and thick grassy areas). My question, then, is if this is something that could be fixed by adding an extra garbage tier of graphics options to the launcher, or if there's some larger issue I'm not grasping. At this point, I'm willing to accept almost any hit in graphics to make the things run smoother. I just want to enjoy the rest of it without having to wait through five seconds of lag every time I want to move my character.\n\nAny help is appreciated!

"Superliminal","Puzzle","What are the best settings to tweak in the launcher to improve performance?","Fuzzball","1","Just started playing this game today, and I'm doing my best to tweak the graphics to give good performance. My specs are a few years old and a laptop, but not terrible:\n\n1920x1080 60Hz\nQuad core i7-3630QM 2.4GHz\n8GB RAM\nGTX 675MX\n\nWhen I start the game the launcher says Medium settings are recommended, which I then adjust to 1080p. I play in full screen with v-sync on, and turn \""multisampling\"" off. Performance is mostly OK, but framerate drops down to 40-50fps and movement chugs in certain areas. These seem to be places with lots of foliage.\n\nFor example, when I run down the hill that's next to the opening fort\/courtyard, towards the path with blue panels on the left, green panels in a wooden hut on the right and pink trees in the distance.\n\nWhen I change the settings in the launcher to Low, performance tends to remain constant 60fps, but I don't like how pixelated my character's shadow looks. Funnily enough, if I set the options to  \""Low\"" but then change the individual Advanced Settings to \""Medium\"", the shadows remain pixellated. But if I then turn up the main settings option to Medium, the shadows improve a bit, even though those Advanced Settings are all the same. So it seems there are some graphical settings going on in the background that change when you change main graphics settings, but can't be affected when you customise stuff in Advanced Settings.\n\nSorry for my late to the party ignorance. Can anyone suggest which Advanced Settings in the launcher to tweak that improve performance? I'm afraid I'm not very technically knowledgeable  and so am not really sure what each of these available options affects. But while I don't usually notice subtle differences, I will be able to able to see a big change (i.e. going from everything being Medium to everything being Low).\n\nSo yeah, what can I tweak? I'd rather not have to lower the resolution or go directly into the game's files if possible.\n\nThanks for helping me combat my ignorance.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/368542844481799119/","12/01/2024 11:05:27","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Am I doing something wrong?","ehwil2","11","Bought game two days ago and returned it yesterday when I could not seem to get it to run. It would boot up and then go to a screen that looked like you used to see on your TV long ago when a channel stopped broadcasting for the night. I could click in the center of that screen and then got a small, round, white cursor which I could move around the screen and that was it. Anyone else had this happen? Did I miss something? Is there an easy fix. Want to play the game but don't want to spend hours trying to make it work. If there is an easy fix will repurchase game.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/371919771755738165/","12/01/2024 11:05:29","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Crashing in same spot","Bryguy","8","So I am computer stupid and I loved Braid and puzzle games so I wanted The Witness.  I use a macbook but I busted out my laptop I got from school about 4 years to play it.  It is a Toshiba Protege 13\"" R830, pretty much stock exact I doubled the ram.  The game keeps crashing in the same spot, in the tutorial courtyard.  I can walk around 90% of the courtyard without concern but as soon as I try to go into one of the wall corner rooms for the puzzle, it crashes with the witness64_d3d11.exe stuff.  I have tried to do the alt + enter, the turning off vsync, running it in high quality mode, basically everything i can find and nothing works.\n\nbasically, i want to know if my computer can handle it, or if there is a bug in the game.  i bought this yesterday (4\/8\/16) and have been playing the stupid courtyard for an hour and a half to fix it.  nothing works.  should i just try to get my money back and retry a little later, or is there something else i should be doing. if it matters, when you first start the game and walk out of the tunnel into the courtyard, it is the room to the far left in front of you.  every other area and puzzle works, but just outside that room, it crashes.  \n\ni want reiterate that i am computer stupid.  i wanted to play on my mac and it talked about a boot camp partition, but i don't know what any of that means.  i am not into games on my computer, mainly just xbox one so if it takes some technical know-how to fix, i am screwed.  i just want to play this puzzle game and move on with my life.  thanks for the help.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/371919771749287767/","12/01/2024 11:05:31","bug report"
"Superliminal","Puzzle","Crashing / rebooting PC consistently in specific area","Scratch17","5","Hey, guys.

I bought The Witness maybe two weeks ago, and I've been playing it on and off for a while now. Really loving it. But today I upgraded my graphics card from a nVidia GTX 570 to a GTX 970. I was then playing for a while, maybe 10 minutes, and then in the Treehouse area, learning about the coloured stars, my PC shuts down and then restarts. No blue screen, no crash to desktop, just a full-on reboot. I go back in, the game loads in the same area, I turn a corner heading to a puzzle and it restarts again.

At first I thought it was the card, overtemp, or the power supply. I have a 850W in my rig, so the power consumption shouldn't be an issue. I then run a bunch of other games and apps I had installed to test and see if they also crash, and I have a temperature monitoring app open on the other monitor.

FurMark: 1080P preset test, max GPU temp +- 65°C, 4000+ score. No crash.
Bioshock Infinite: Benchmark test and a few minutes of gameplay, 1080P ultra graphics DX11, max temp (CPU and GPU) +- 55°C. No crash.
Dishonored: Max graphics available from in-game menus, max temp (CPU and GPU) +- 50°C. No crash.
Portal Stories: Mel: Played about an hour, max graphics, 1080P, max temp (CPU and GPU) +- 50°C. No crash.

I found at least 2 posts about people suffering from crashes (albeit crash to desktop) happening at around the same area of the map, and the GTX 970 was mentioned too. Does anyone have any concrete information about this crash, or can give me hints on how to possibly diagnose the issue?

PC info:
GALAX nVidia GTX 970 (brand new)
Core i7 950
850W PSU
24GB RAM

TL:DR; I play The Witness for a less than an hour with my new GTX 970 and it causes PC to reboot when I'm in the Treehouse area, but not during other games. Any ideas?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/371919771756777943/","12/01/2024 11:05:33","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","Choppy water - Framerate issue","Club_Shrimp","2","Posted this in general discussions by accident.\n\nBasically, in the last few days, any and all water that moves in the game, for me, has started to look noticeably choppy. It definitely didn't always look like this. On the other hand, the rest of the game still looks and performs great.\n\nObviously there haven't been any updates, so I'm not sure what's causing this. Has anyone else experienced this? Or, does anyone have any idea what might be causing it?\n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: Oh and here's my log.txt\n\nThe Witness - x64 - D3D11 - Final\nVersion 0.954M\nBuilt 2016\/01\/23 14:35:20 from 131468\nInit app:\n    Init core:\n        Init asset loader:\n            Using unbundled processed asset list\n            23.49 ms elapsed\n        25.39 ms elapsed\n    Init render:\n        OS: PlatformId 2, Version 6.1, Build 7601\n        D3D11: Found 1 adapter outputs.\n        D3D11: SDK version 7\n        D3D11: Adapter = 'NVIDIA GeForce GTX 880M'\n        D3D11: Output device = '\\\\.\\DISPLAY1'\n        D3D11: VendorId = 0x10DE (NVIDIA)\n        D3D11: DeviceId = 0x1198\n        NVAPI: Driver 344.0\n        NVAPI: 1 attached displays, 3 unattached displays.\n        D3D11: Dedicated Video Memory = 8262336.00 MB\n        D3D11: Dedicated System Memory =   0.00 MB\n        D3D11: Shared System Memory = 16475422.00 MB\n        D3D11: Created D3D11 device with feature level 11.0\n        D3D11: concurrent_resource_creation = true\n        D3D11: max_texture_size = 16384\n        D3D11: max_texture_buffer_size = 16384\n        NVAPI: 1 AFR groups.\n        WIN32: 8388607 MB of virtual addressing space detected.\n        1.47 s elapsed\n    1.50 s elapsed\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/371918937257189225/","12/01/2024 11:05:38","bug report"

"Superliminal","Puzzle","microstutter again. borderless window mode the base cause?","MyuniHausen","0","In my last post about microstutter, the majority of problems were solved by using an alternate vsync option for Nvidia cards, thanks to The Invisibl.\n\nThe Witness runs great now, except for 1 stutter every 60 seconds.\nDigging deeper, I found out that losing v-sync might be connected to the game running in borderless window mode.\nChecking with MGS5, I can confirm this. In borderless window mode v-sync is lost from time to time, resulting in stutter. Switching to exclusive fullscreen solves this issue completely, perfect v-sync, always.\n\nSo, my question is, are there plans introducing exclusive fullscreen to The Witness in the near future to address this issue? Would it be difficult, possible at all to do so?\n\ngreetings,\nMyuniHausen","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/412448792368804400/","12/01/2024 11:05:46","bug report"

"Obduction","Puzzle","Making Obduction work under WINE in Linux (In Progress)","Doctor Timbrwulf","55","[i]For those of you who would rather have Obduction work natively on Linux instead of trying to hack the Windows version, [url=http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/306760\/discussions\/3\/1480982338966487223\/]please see this thread[\/url].[\/i]

According to [url=http:\/\/support.cyanworlds.com\/kb\/articles\/will-there-be-a-linux-version-of-obduction]Cyan Support[\/url], there is no Linux version planned. This does not mean there [i]won't[\/i] be one, but it's unlikely that there will be. The best bet to get it working on Linux is either to run a virtual machine (which means you're not using Linux directly; you're using Windows or Mac), or use an emulator. This discussion is about getting the Windows version of Obduction working on Linux using Wine (often stylized as WINE, but it's simpler to not use all-caps).

[h1]How can I use WINE\/Proton to make Obduction work?[\/h1]
[b]On August 21st 2018, Steam announced that in the Client Beta for Linux, you can install and run Windows games via Steam Play.[\/b] In order to do this, please follow these steps (I added the numbers to the quote):
[quote=t3opc;1736588252394279127]1. Get latest steam beta (if not in beta: Steam menu item -> settings -> change to beta and restart)

2. Go back to Steam menu item -> settings and then to Steam Play and enable for all titles. Restart if it asks you to and then install Obduction. That's it! ;-)[\/quote]
You can see the full post (#47) [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/306760\/discussions\/1\/1698294337774979187\/#c1736588252394279127]here[\/url]. You may also try to get the Windows version of Steam and use Winetricks or PlayOnLinux. For those instructions, see [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/306760\/discussions\/1\/1698294337774979187\/?tscn=1534720595#c1697175413678344026]post #35[\/url].

[i]Update: Running Windows games via Steam Play now a default feature in the stable release.[\/i]

You can also make it work manually using [url=https:\/\/github.com\/Matoking\/protontricks]Protontricks[\/url]:

[quote=sorthious;1609400247629841012]The AppID [is] 306760, [but] if you have protontricks you can use: protontricks -s <game_name> to find an AppID.

When running the shell script you actually need to point to the Wine Bottle where the game is located, followed by the command to launch the script.  It's probably best to just unzip the folder into your Obduction folder under the ...steamapps\/compatdata folder.  Once that's done, change directory to that folder via terminal.  Then, type the following command to launch it:

[code]$ WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX=""\/home\/<username>\/.steam\/steam\/steamapps\/compatdata\/306760\/pfx"" .\/install-mf.sh[\/code]

After that you should be good to go.[\/quote]

[i]Protontricks requires the Steam Client Beta, Python 3.4 or newer, and Winetricks to be installed on your Linux system![\/i]

[h1]I just got an error in trying to make Obduction work. What does it mean?[\/h1]
These are the most likely errors you may get when trying to make Obduction work in Wine. I ran across these errors due to the fact that the hardware of my Ubuntu laptop is not sufficient enough to run Obduction, but just because you have the minimal requrements doesn't mean that you won't still run across them. These errors were produced using PlayOnLinux under pretty much any Wine version available. All other settings not mentioned are system default.
[list]
[*] Using GDI as the DirectDraw Renderer:
[code]DX11 feature level 10.0 is required to run this engine.[\/code]
This basically means that Obduction is using DirectX 10 features in DirectX 11. If your system supports DX10, you can attempt to run it, but you might want to be safe and make sure that your hardware will [i]at least[\/i] support DX11. [i][url=https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feature_levels_in_Direct3D]Learn more about feature levels here.[\/url][\/i]
[*] Using GDI and appending an argument to use DirectX 10:
[code]DX11 feature level 10.0 is required to run this engine.[\/code]
You can force DirectX 10 by right-clicking on the game in your Steam library, click [i]Properties[\/i], then click [i]Set Launch Options...[\/i] and type ""-dx10"" or ""-d3d10"". However, DirectX 11 seems to still be required.
[*] Using DirectX 9, switching to Windows 7 or older, OR switching from GDI as the renderer (when not forcing OpenGL):
[code]The global shader cache file 'C:\/Program Files(x86)\/steam\/steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Engine\/GlobalShaderCache-PCD3D_SM4.bin' is missing. 

Your application is built to load COOKED content. No COOKED content was found; This usually means you did not cook content for this build. It also may indicate missing cooked data for a shader platform(e.g., OpenGL under Windows): Make sure your platform's packaging settings include this Target RHI. 

Alternatively build and run the UNCOOKED version instead.[\/code]
This usually means that the virtual hardware is not supported or out of date, but it can also mean that something is truly missing. Do a file verification check in the Steam client; if all the files are there, reinstall. If it still doesn't work, then there's either missing dependencies or your hardware is out of date.
[*] Forcing OpenGL with argument ""-opengl"", with GLSL support on and the renderer using OpenGL:
[code]The global shader cache file C:\/Program Files(x86)\/steam\/steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Engine\/GlobalShaderCache-GLSL_150.bin' is missing. 

Your application is built to load COOKED content. No COOKED content was found; This usually means you did not cook content for this build. It also may indicate missing cooked data for a shader platform(e.g., OpenGL under Windows): Make sure your platform's packaging settings include this Targeted RHI. 

Alternatively build and run the UNCOOKED version instead.[\/code]
The hardware is still unsupported, or dependancies are not met. I think OpenGL 4 is the minimum. This is a common error on Mac OS, as well.
[*] Using the ""-vulkan"" argument outputs ""[i]Fatal error![\/i]"". Vulkan may not be supported yet by your hardware.
[\/list]

[h1]What hardware is recommended to run Obduction in Wine?[\/h1]
I've edited this section to include what I think should be the minimum hardware requirements to run the game in Wine.
[list]
[*][b]OS Version – Windows 7 SP1 64 bit or newer.[\/b] Wine can fool a program into thinking it's any version of Windows, so this is easy to fulfill. Any Linux version can run Wine, but I recommend Ubuntu.
[*][b]Processor – CPU [url=https:\/\/ark.intel.com\/products\/52209\/Intel-Core-i5-2500-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_70-GHz]Intel i5-2500 equivalent[\/url] or better.[\/b] If you don't have it already, definitely look into a quad core with no less than 2.5 GHz for each core.
[*][b]Memory – 8GB+ RAM.[\/b] May want to make that 12 GB or more, since having to run it through Wine takes up more resources than running it natively on Windows.
[*][b]Graphics – GeForce 660 GTX \/ AMD 7700 series equivalent or better.[\/b] You definitely need a graphics card with DirectX 11 support (similar to OpenGL 4.x).
[*][b]VRAM – 1 GB.[\/b] May be dependant on system memory. [i]Mine supports 2 GB.[\/i]
[*][b]Network – Broadband Internet not required to play.[\/b] No comment. 
[*][b]Disk Space: 20 GB.[\/b] Disk space needed for Obduction in Wine may be larger, so try to reserve double that much.
[*][b]Additional Notes : DirectX 11 (not 12) required.[\/b] See graphics.
[*][b]Note: Does not include minimum VR specs.[\/b] No comment.

"Obduction","Puzzle","Kaptar Stuck Bug","Phil Swift","4","I'm not certain if the devs are aware of this, or if it is even worth them fixing, but today I was practicing a speedrun (no glitch exploit other than diagonal walk speed being faster than walking straight forward, nor will I mention here the exploits I have found) and several times as I have been walking down the stairs in the Kaptar, I somehow manage to get off the stairs and onto the walls around them and there is no way to get back to the stairs from several of the places this can happen (wall is higher after you accidentally get on it, and since you are not supposed to be there in the first place you can't get back).  The game, with its autosaving, autosaves when I find myself in such a predicament so i have to start a new game all over again.  This bug is really impeding my ability to speedrun this game (not a game popular for speedruns, but this is just for myself and a friend for our own personal enjoyment).  Again, I want to emphasize that I am NOT trying to glitch into walls or anything of the sort.  Quite the opposite, in fact, since the ground rules for our speedrun between the two of us prohibit any such exploitation.  I just wanted to bring this to the attention of the devs in case it is something they do decide they would like to fix, I expect it probably isn't worth their time, but no harm in bringing it to someone's attention right?  Now you have the information, and any other would-be speedrunners are forewarned of a potential pitfall related to diagonal (up+left, up+right, etc.) walking in a non-VR (I cannot speak for this in VR as I do not have a VR device) game.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/1729827777355579648/","12/01/2024 11:07:04","bug report"

"Obduction","Puzzle","Cart stuck in tight tunnel without me in it, can't get back in","blueorca","9","Went to Kaptar and came back to Hunrath via the second swap machine to get the mine cart for disabling the red beam.  After I drove the mine cart into the tunnel behind the swap machine, I was clicking around and clicked the Exit door of the cart by accident.  Amazingly, the door opened to let me exit, but automatically dumped me onto a small rock outcrop inside the corner of the room with the swap machine on the other side of the wooden tunnel wall from the cart.  \n\nI was stuck on this rock pile and could not get off into the room nor back into the cart because it is now on the other side of the wall.  I switched controls back and forth between Point-and-Click and Free Roam and it finally dislodged me, but into the room side.  \n\nNow I can walk around back into the tunnel, but the cart is there already with no room on either side for me to get back in.  Any way to recall the cart to an open area so I can get back in?  Or do I have to restart the game at this point?

I know how the Villeins work, I know how to solve them and fill out the Villein squares. 
So when I originally reached where the pods are the villein was fine, I typed 222 in it and it brought me the mayor. 
But then I realised I might've missed the Sweet Caroline achievement so I loaded a save from when I had just reached the pod area, went to go type 194 in the system, and saw that I couldn't.

The number 217 (I think anyway) is PERMANENTLY typed out. [b]I can't erase it[\/b], and if I add to it, it brings me low number pods like 40 and 45 and I have no idea what to do??? And if I etch out what I added to it to bring me pods (lke 40 and 45) then it sends me back up to the top.

I tried loading an even EARLIER save, from when I had just finished Soria and was just starting to go through the left path of the maze, and still the number 217 is there.

Please help me, this game previously deleted my save like 2 years ago (I had just reached the Gauntlet when this happened) and I've finally managed to get back into it and finish it but this is just ♥♥♥♥ing me over at this point.


Edit: I saw a post where someone said that it just looks like it's there, so I went ahead and typed 194 over the top of the number that was there and it worked, I got the achievement. 

[b]BUT[\/b] 222 is still not working. I even made a point to go over all the lines on the villein and ""erase them"" (can't actually be erased because of the glitch) and then try inputting 222 numerous times and ways and it is not calling up the mayor.


What the ♥♥♥♥ do I do

There is absolutely no way I'm going to playthrough this game a third ♥♥♥♥ing time

"Obduction","Puzzle","Giant fan inoperable in VR","stub","0","After spinning up the giant fan, you need to use a device to connect up the mechanical power. I can use this just fine in normal mode. However, in VR, it is practically unusable. You step forward from the top of the small ramp, and the platform rotates away (in the direction the lever currently is in), and the player teleports back to the top of the ramp. If you are really quick, you can grab hold of the lever and can even use it after the teleport if you are lucky, withyour hand is detached from your body and remaining on the spinning platform. The alternative approach of physically stepping forward onto the rotating platform from the top of the ramp just gives you a black screen until you step back.

I'm not sure if the patch had anything to do with it as I hadn't checked on the minecart in a long time but today when I finally needed it again, it was embedded half way into the asphalt as shown in the screenshots below.

"Obduction","Puzzle","Having ""Shimmering""/Draw-Distance Issues Ruining Immersion - didn't happen before","TheInfomaniac","6","Hi everyone! I made a post about this a long time ago in the general discussion but I only just realized that there's a whole technical discussion forum, so I thought I'd post it here as it's really messing up my experience.\n\nIn both 2D and VR, something weird happens when I get close to an object. It will \""shimmer\"" (it almost looks like the transporter from Star Trek) and then the model gets replaced with a more detailed version. An example of this are the small succulents in the starting area. From far away, they look a little more basic but when you get close they \""shimmer\"" and a more detailed model with more branches appears. This also happens with shadows, rocks, buildings, pretty much everything in the game.\n\nNow, every game has LOD and pop-in, so that's not an issue in itself. However, it's extremely distracting when teleporting in VR because all the detailed models load about one second after I teleport, so everything in the world shimmers and is replaced. For big buildings it is extremely immersion-breaking. (Also, it happens when an object is like 5 feet away, which seems closer in distance than most games have LOD changes).\n\nThis does not happen if I turn of motion controls and use the traditional \""Myst\"" node movement - for some reason when I jump to another node everything is loaded fine. However, I really like using motion controls in this game.\n\n Also, I played about 4 hours of the game in the spring and it didn't do this, but then one day it suddenly did. I tried multiple reinstalls, settings changes, etc. and it didn't change anything. I put the game on hold until a new update was released but I tried it yesterday and it still happens.\n\nTLDR Version: All the game's objects have a pop-in \""Shimmering\"" that happens when I'm a couple feet from an object. It happens when teleporting with motion controls but doesn't happen if I ditch motion controls and go with the node-based movement. I've tried reinstalls, changing settings, etc. and nothing fixes it (and it doesn't seem to be tied to any in-game settings, even the draw distance setting). It didn't do this when I first started the game but now it has consistently done it ever since the issue first appeared.\n\nCan anyone help me? I've loved this game so far but it's a big annoyance to have this shimmering happen all the time.\n\nSpecs:\nCPU: Intel i7-7700\nGPU: Nvidia GTX 1080ti (Asus version with 11gb VRAM)\n32 gb of RAM\n\nThanks so much!","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/1636418037463189359/","12/01/2024 11:07:58","bug report"

True Fullscreen mode fixed these problems but then the game \""fails\"" to send an HDR flag to my display [Sony ZD9\/Z9D] and HDR is disabled.\n\nI find this very confusing because most PC games REQUIRE [exclusive] fullscreen to have HDR work properly.

But there seems to be a bug at near the end, and it's a weird one.\n\nBefore heading for the bleeder detonator, I unplugged the battery and just for the sake of it went to the water tank. Saw the lever and out of nowhere a \""what if\"" question spawned in my head.\n\nI turned the lever and it stopped water supply to the trees(!). The leaves turned red and after a few seconds reverted back to green although supply was off(!!). Then as soon as I turned back and started walking away from the tank the computer crashed and went into a hard reset(!!?).\n\nNext time the game loaded from near the tank and water supply was on. I turned it off again and the same thing repeated - system hard reset. :-|\n\nIdeally, the player should not be allowed to go near the tank at near ending and\/or turning the lever should have no effect once water is turned on. But the game seems to allow the player to do it (but clearly doesn't have the code for managing a situation where water is turned off after watering all four trees), leading to some kind of fatal exception I guess and resulting in system reset instead of just the program getting closed.\n\nHope some light is shed on this.\nThanks\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/1697169163395438619/","12/01/2024 11:08:35","bug report"

"Obduction","Puzzle","VR with an R9 390?","Larry","0","Anyone tried playing this with an R9 390 or GTX 970 in VR? It's on sale on the oculus store at the moment and everyone says some pretty amazing things about this game in VR. I'm tempted to buy it but at the same time I don't want to waste €15 on a game I can hardly run.

I'm a stickler for sticking to requirements for games but I do find it a bit weird the requirements for this game are a 980 or a Fury or even a 1060(Which should be on par with an R9 390).

I plan on upgrading probably next gen but I'd rather pay now for something I can enjoy then get it cheap now and wait a few months later for Volta or Navi to hit the streets.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/1486613649674161681/","12/01/2024 11:09:12","bug report"

"Obduction","Puzzle","Obduction [publicpreview] VR problems","Wolfram","7","First, thanks a lot for working on improved VR support! A game like Obduction with such a wonderful world deserves to be fully experienced in a way that only VR allows!\n\nMy setup is VR: SteamVR (HTC Vive), CPU: Intel Core i7-4790K, GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti, RAM: 16 GB, OS: Windows 10 Pro.\n\n1st problem: Trying to start the game in VR while already in VR and using the SteamVR dashboard offers two options, one for SteamVR, one for Oculus. The Oculus option crashes, the SteamVR option launches the game on the Desktop, not in VR. To get VR going, I had to quit VR and run the game from the Desktop shortcut, which was quite counter-intuitive.\n\n2nd problem: Resolution automatically decreases, causing extreme blur, making the game almost unplayable. The resolution apparently jumps to minimum when text is displayed (during the intro) or when reading notes, maybe at other times as well. The change is not reflected in the menu's resolution slider! But when I change the slider just one step to the left or right and apply, then the resolution is fine again - until it changes again on its own!\n\n3rd problem: Although I chose advanced\/free locomotion, I could only teleport. And I had to press and hold the thumb button to activate teleport, which is suboptimal. If there are options, I didn't find them, the menu only showed keyboard actions. Pressing the thumb button should be an option, because just touching instead of pressing it works much better for me. Of course, true touchpad locomotion based on the controller (not head orientation) would be best, so I hope that's possible (maybe I just overlooked the option?).\n\nThat said, the world itself looks incredibly beautiful and wonderous - while resolution isn't minimized automatically. I'm looking forward to my three issues getting fixed so I can finally enjoy this great game and VR experience! Thanks again and good luck in getting the new update going - this gem deserves a much better reception and larger audience in VR! :)","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/2381701715718138423/","12/01/2024 11:09:23","bug report"

"Obduction","Puzzle","Windows Users: Dealing with COOKED content problems","CoyoteTraveller","3","The global shader cache file 'C:\/Program Files(x86)\/steam\/steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Engine\/GlobalShaderCache-PCD3D_SM4.bin' is missing.\n\nYour application is built to load COOKED content. No COOKED content was found; This usually means you did not cook content for this build. It also may indicate missing cooked data for a shader platform(e.g., OpenGL under Windows): Make sure your platform's packaging settings include this Target RHI.\n\nAlternatively build and run the UNCOOKED version instead.\n\nFatal error!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of 8\/27\/2016, this means your system DOES NOT SUPPORT DIRECTX 11.  Unreal Engine 4 detects which version your system supports, and tries to load version-specific shader files.  Those shader files are present for DX11 (probably in the .pak file) but not for DX10, so it has no way to load them. Same with OpenGL, if you try and shove command-line flags onto it: no shader files, no work.  Different error messages indicate different problems.\n\nMaybe there will be a patch to add shader files; I hope so!  Maybe not.  Install the latest drivers for your graphics card, if it's remotely recent, but at this point DX11 has been out long enough that everyone should have drivers if they exist.  If you see this error, you should consider the game incompatible with your graphics card.  Sorry.  Wait for information from Cyan about whether they can add support for DX10, it's up to them.\n\nSupposedly, you can run 'dxdiag' to see what DirectX version you have installed.  Mine says DX11!  But I think that it's lying.  Or rather, I have it installed, but my graphics card doesn't support it.  You probably have the same problem.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHowever, in the meantime, there is a workaround. You do not want this workaround unless you like running at 1.5 FPS or maybe much worse (and 10 seconds per frame before you turn down the graphics settings).  You won't get any sound, either.  Seriously, consider this game to be incompatible, I'm not kidding.  But since I did the same thing with WATCH_DOGS and it took me like two days of effort to get it working, I might as well save you the trouble and condense all the information in one place.  But remember, you're wasting your time.\n\nIf you're not very familiar and comfortable with hacking at the inner workings of your computer, stop now.  Not kidding.  It's not compatible yet.\n\nTry start->run->type 'dxcpl'.  This is a DirectX debugging tool, and it lets you fake what version you have, either up or down.  If you have it, cool, you can skip the next step.  If you don't, no fun for you; you get to uninstall and install some junk.\n\nTo get dxcpl, you want the Windows SDK.  This link is for Windows 8 but apparently it works for Windows 7 as well. https:\/\/developer.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/downloads\/windows-8-sdk This is specifically Windows 7 and .Net framework 3.5: https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=3138 If those don't get you dxcpl, then I don't know what will.  I'm not kidding, it took like two days to find a copy, and it wasn't worth it.  Just don't try and download it from a third party site because that's how you get viruses, man.  You want it from an actual Microsoft sdk.\n\nOkay, now that you have dxcpl installed.  Open it up.  Go to 'edit list', which tells it which files to manipulate.  Add C:\\Program Files (x86)\\steam\\steamapps\\common\\Obduction\\ (or wherever Obduction is installed), it'll warn you that this will impact everything in that folder, and that's what you want.\n\nBottom of the window, Feature level limit: 11_0, 'force WARP' on.  That should be everything you need.  I also have debug layer force off, mute all messages, disable feature level upgrade on, no break settings.\n\nNow run it.  Glorious 10 seconds per frame!  Your life is hell.  Wait a couple minutes to get to the title screen, hold down the mouse button on settings until it opens the window, go to graphics at a glacial pace, turn down the graphics settings all the way, hit apply...and welcome to 1.5 frames per second.  On my machine at least, I can't even make it windowed, and that's probably a feature of this terrible hack.  Was it worth it?  No.  Not really.  Also note the lack of sound.  Maybe you can go into steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Obduction_Soundtrack and guess at what you're supposed to play, but I don't recommend it.  I don't recommend any of this.  Why did you do it?  Why?  That's between you and God.\n\nDon't do this.  It's a waste of time.\n\nAnd remember that if Cyan releases a patch that enables DX10, go back into dxcpl and remove Obduction from the list, otherwise you're gonna have a bad time and not get any benefit from a better version.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/350540780272650744/","12/01/2024 11:09:33","bug report"

Or do I have to start the game from the beginning again?\n\nBest,\nBen","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/359547436766116782/","12/01/2024 11:09:36","bug report"

"Obduction","Puzzle","Why is Obduction reading my network shares?","Fox","2","Okay so first off, love the game. Kind of. Great game, execution is, frankly, lacking. Holy crap. This comes from the perspective of an experienced programmer, this isn't my first wrangle, yadda yadda whatever, nobody cares.\n\nNote: Zero spoilers, just some ire and a little disappointment.\n\nLet's start our complaints with the fact that the shaders are terribly structured and optimized, causing extremely slow processing in general - it's pretty, but let's tone it down a bit, yeah? Maybe ease back off the reference implementation of the blur shader that apparently also considers iris shape for some reason? Back down on the processing just a little bit, drop a few places of precision with the trivial things you know they won't notice, or at least do it in a sane order and number of batches per buffer.\n\nThen, there's the model depth dispatches on LOD change being so inefficient that the game stutters and stumbles any time there's a change in complexity, relative directly to the complexity of said change. Yeah I know, I don't have the latest hardware blah blah here's the thing; my hardware should be able to run my settings. I know that because other games - one of which looks OUTSTANDING by the way - run much better with similar visual compromises - note, not similar settings, because \""Medium\"" is subjective not objective and thus is an invalid comparison note, I speak of adjusting it to a similar subjective visual level of detail. In any case: That, too, really makes this almost impossible to enjoy.\n\nAdd to it the fact that the game doesn't apply its graphics settings properly when started. Like, WHAT!? How in the world could such a thing even be a thing? I thought I was nuts too, but here's the thing. I started the game, the first time, and spent a while messing with settings to make it run almost alright..quit, came back to it, and it ran terribly, and I thought \""WOW, did I just get USED to this?\""  After poking ONE thing in the video settings menu - notably, Resolution Scale (it was some over-long LINE OF WORDS instead of \""100\"")  life was again grand. I also sometimes had this happen with my video resolution - it was set to 1920x1080, or at least that's where I had put it - it would sometimes read 400x300 or some stupid value like that. It was always the same, as if the select box had no \""invalid\"" default set, again. ... Wait, that's twice now...\n\nLet's stop here for a sec. Seriously? EVERY TIME I changed this (Resolution Scale) then close Settings, go back to the game, go back to Setings, and it's a LINE OF WORDS again. Something like \""Invalid number\"" or such, I'd imagine, because whoever designed the UI also didn't deign to assign a font size other than \""stretch to fill\"" so the UI elements CHANGE SIZE ALL OF THE TIME, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? You can't write a function that sanitizes input and restores a default value if the one you're coming up with from preferences is invalid? (Are you sanitizing ANY of the user input? You're not, are you!?) You can't write a function that properly SAVES a setting? You can't write a function that properly LOADS a setting? Obviously the first one is true or I wouldn't see an error message crammed into a numeric field. Obviously one of the other two seems to be as well, if it saved AND loaded properly the number wouldn't have been invalidated to begin with. Then there's the fact that it happened with my Resolution as well, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nANYWAYS. So. After dealing with the settings stupidity, it ran smoothly once more - mostly, of course, everyone knows this doesn't run \""smoothly\"" on most systems.\n\nThen I restarted it again, and it was terrible again. Restarted the computer, then the game, fixed the settings, restarted the computer AND the game again - just to be thorough - and hey it worked. Nope, just kidding - it still forgot all of my settings. Clean install, clean driver install, I tried this a few dozen times. I eventually went offline on Friends because someone complained that I'd been starting and logging on too much. Seriously, I tested this every way I could to prove that it's not just some odd glitch of my system.\n\nSo, then I did something REALLY easy to spot. I changed the RESOLUTION, down to 1280x720. (Game runs only slightly better at this res, by the way.)  Now when I start the game, though, it's in 1920x1080 (according to Windows, my monitor, and my GPU) until I go to Settings, where it already says 1280x720, change it to anything, then change it back, and hit Apply. Then, it's CLEARLY 720p, and all of my other settings apply as well.\n\n\nBut wait, this was about it accessing my network shares, remember? Yeah, after all of this, I tried to enter the game and it would hang on the load screen. I have a NAS, with a faulty drive that fails to spin up sometimes, with a drive letter mapped in My Computer. (Replacement is on the way, don't you worry.)  Well, when it doesn't spin up, any attempt to access the drive hangs in IO Wait on the thread, I can hear the drive stumble a few times then spin up, click click whir, and then IO Wait clears and everything is fine. Guess what game just did exactly that? You guessed it, Obduction. So I waited for the thing to spin down again. Then re-launched Obduction, re-loaded my save, same hang until the thing spun up again. So then I unplugged the ethernet cable, and tried again - and Obduction STAYED HUNG until I forced Windows to remove the mapping, at which point my save loaded nearly instantly.\n\nSo, aside from apparently \""Where can I submit an application?\"" I suppose my question stands:\n\n\nWhy in the wide broad world is Obduction reading from my network shares?\n","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/1457328846182386954/","12/01/2024 11:09:38","bug report"

"Obduction","Puzzle","On the Wrong Side of Collision","TheStranger117","1","I believe I've found myself on the wrong side of collision on what I believe is Maray (The Villein world). I'm running the game on a Dell Inspiron 15, 7000 series. Anyway, I've been working my way through the Gauntlet while alternating trying to find my way to the tree on the steampunk\/stone world. I was headed back to the main seed with which you use to get from Hunrath to Maray (the one that's initially on Hunrath that you can access as soon as you shut down the dome disabler there). I got to the area where you have to teleport the stone arch in from Hunrath, and noticed yellow leaves floating in the air and went to investigate. This resulted in me 'slipping' a bit off the cliff and being unable to get up. A bit of navigating resulted in me slipping off the cliff to the bottom of the canyon - one teleport to the opposite side of the dome had me walking on the creek - I believe this was not intended, as the sound effects were those from when I'm walking on grass. Anyway, I get to the coast of the river next to the tree on Maray, and am unable to get up on land - this is what led me to believe I was on the wrong side of collision. I navigated across the river up towards the intended path to get to said tree, and wasn't able to get onto the intended bath (right in front of the deactivated bridge) either. Anyway, I'm basically trapped on Maray, unable to do anything until this gets resolved (or I start a new save).\n\nHelp????","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/1354868867722125726/","12/01/2024 11:09:42","bug report"

"Obduction","Puzzle","Forced updates crashes game","The Teacher","0","I have the same issue as diskussed here often. Today I just wanted to play the last few parts of Obduction. But it is only frustrating. Steam forces me to update the working game. It took about 30 minutes to download the update. And after that the game runs extreme laggy. Nearly not playable anymore. And every few minutes it crashes completely.

Why is everybody thinking he have to force it's user to do every update at once. I want to PLAY the game not to wait and wait and wait until I may play. Even if the game works perfectly. And then they make things worse than before. Why they can simply say there is an update available und let the user decide to install it.

So my game is gone for me. I cannot play it anymore.

I will buy no more games which runs over Steam until that forced update functionality is gone.
Bad enough that I cannot use any new game without having a giant fast internet connection. There are peoply who don't live in a big city with GB\/sec fast internet.

After restarting, with the Task Manager running on my second screen, I saw that the game was using 15.9GB from my 16GB RAM available. The commit size was constantly rising; I killed the process when it reached 27GB.
On my C-Drive (SSD) I have 2GB available for the pagefile and my two other HDDs are set to system managed (currently both pagefiles have a size of 17GB).

On the next day (today) I tried to start a new game and keep the Task Manager open on my second screen. It took me about two hours to reach the same progress as before. The RAM was constantly between 3 and 5 GB, but just at the moment I caught up with the progress the memory usage jumped back up to 16GB and the game froze. 

Both times [spoiler]I had watered the tree in Hunrath and Kaptar, went to Maray solved the bridges and took the capsule to the shooting and then tried to leave the scene. The first time I tried to get back to Hunrath to ask C.W. what to do next when the game froze; the second time I went back to the maze because I wanted to try to use a capsule with a closed door – closed the door, went back to the labyrinth,[\/spoiler] game froze.

Maybe there is some memory leakage when you leave the shooting scene without looking up [spoiler]Josef’s cell[\/spoiler]? Maybe someone else could check if he has the same problems there?

It does stay around 4G mem used when hung, which might be something internal.\n\nI saw something about changing the language, though that was pre-patch.

"Obduction","Puzzle","*BUG* Poor laptop specs land you waist-deep in a staircase.","soulsukkur","2","I have a lower-end laptop, and thus have to run the game on the lowest quality settings possible. It turns out to be genuinely problematic. I've been playing for nearly a week, making slow progress because I'm not as good as puzzles as I'd like to be (I still wish there was some indication that compass belonged to Roscoe)\n\nAnyway, I was in the area of Kaptar with the massive crank shaft. After getting it started, I tried going back the main ambassador seed used to get there. On the way there, if you don't use the elevator, you have to round a ninety-degree corner down some stairs. Since they hadn't been in view before the turn, and my graphics settings are at minimum, the entire section of staircase around the bend hadn't loaded yet. It loaded quickly, but it did so in such an order that I managed to start falling through the staircase before it was fully loaded. Once it was finished, I found myself in the situation that titles this discussion. No amount of moving or quitting was able to remove me from the stairs, so I had to take an hour and a half to redo all the progress I had made in the past week (puzzle games take a lot longer the first time through). \n\nEarly on in this recovery playthrough, when I went through the membrane on Hunrath, the game stuttered at the exact time I was going to pass through. I ended up just outside Hunrath, embedded in the marbled purple terrain. Luckily, you aren't supposed to be out there, so there were no collisions to keep me stuck there. If such issues could be fixed, I'd appreciate it. If they have been fixed already (I was running 1.3.6 or something) then I apologize.\n\nRegards,\nme.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/215439774862015689/","12/01/2024 11:11:00","bug report"

Until they return, I cannot do construction from my personal roboport.  Eventually they come limping home, or I look around on radar and sweep them up.  \n\nHowever, now I have a game where they seem to have gone off to a permanent limbo.  I've blanketed the map with radar and cannot find them.  I've sat in one spot for 30 minutes waiting for them to come limping home, but they don't arrive.  The land-based bots and roboports all work just fine.  My power armor is has a personal roboport mk2, fusion, batteries, solar.  It is topped up and nothing is wrong.  My inventory showing 17 construction bots.   How can I figure out what happened?  Can I \""reset\"" my personal roboport or abandon the lost bots so that new ones will function?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/2971775284250323044/","12/01/2024 11:16:21","bug report"

So I started a new game, played a couple hours only, saved and got the same message when I closed the game.\n\nI figured that after closing the game I can go in my steam library and try to synch again. Most of the times it works. So I guess it is not the end of the world.\n\nOh and for info, when I close the game, from desktop I right click the Steam icon, bottom right, and I see Factorio written in blue, with a blue (or is it white?) ring in front of it.

The path is completely fine since I can do it in manual mode.\n\nIt took me 2 hours, going through dozens of posts on forums with the same issue and watching 4 train videos on youtube before I could get the train to work.\nIt's super convoluted and not explained at all.\n\nThe tutorial comes with broken train tracks + a locomotive + 2 wagons.\n\nWhat you need to actually do to get the train working:\n1) repair the tracks\n2) put signals at each end of the track, on the right side of the track\n3) put a second locomotive, rotate the locomotive to face the intended direction\n4) fill the second locomotive with coal\n5) last but not least, create an automatic route\n\nIt would be great if the tutorial could actually go over all these steps!\n\nThe issue with fuel is especially vicious because the tutorial comes with a locomotive already setup with a coal inserter.\nIf you try to add a second locomotive by chance (good guess or first google answer), you have'd to be super lucky that it comes in the right direction AND guess that it needs fuel, otherwise you're gonna be stuck for hours.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3879348064931748695/","12/01/2024 11:16:36","bug report"
"Factorio","Sandbox","bug: scaling issue on large 4k display?","yento","8","Hello,\n\nI am playing Factorio for the first time, trying the demo before I buy the game\nForgive me if what I am about to report looks stupid to experienced players, I might be the last person on this planet who didn't play this game before. ^^\n\nThe majority of my interactions with the game so far is a stupid error \""cannot reach\"".\nWhenever I click somewhere, it just doesn't work.\nI got that thousands of time since I started playing a few hours ago. \nIT IS INFURIATING!!! The game is just broken to me. \n\nscreenshot:\nhttps:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=3065591346\n\nI understand that the character has to be nearby to what you want to interact with, otherwise you could control the whole map. But this can't be intentional?\n\nPlaying on a large 32 inch 4k display with some scaling.\nSee screenshot, I am at a very reasonable level of zoom and 80% of the screen is impossible to click on? This can't be intentional?\nI can't build anything, I can't open any of the building to see what they do. (Remember I am playing the game for the first time trying to understand what things are).\n\nIn fact I had to give up on using zoom\/unzoom at all. \nIf I zoom close to not have the issue, I can't see more than two buildings away, I cannot play.\nIf I unzoom to be able to see some distance (anything larger than the screenshot), that makes 95% of the screen dead with \""cannot reach\"" errors. The game is unplayable. \n\nMaybe you have a rendering\/scaling issue?\nOr if you decided to limit the playable area 10 years ago when you first released the game, maybe you need to make some adjustments now that size and resolution have increased?\n\nThanks.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3879348064925280044/","12/01/2024 11:16:37","bug report"

Miners are painted red which is also not right. But if I press Shift, miners are painted blue. Miners on the water are painted red with and without Shift.\n\nI would also like Shift-deployment to auto-build ground. For many other blueprints I already made artificial ground a part of blueprint. I manually build artificial ground on water, build ground-less blueprint on artificial water, then capture groundfull blueprint. I cannot do the same with miners blueprint, since I need real ore to be present, to capture miners into blueprint. I cannot have water, artificial ground and miners at the same time in the same place.\n\nAlso, artificial ground is mutually exclusive with other on-the-ground cells, so I cannot have concrete and be able to auto-build on water at the same time.

"Factorio","Sandbox","[DISREGARD/ANSWERED] Lab Research Speed Miscalculation?","WhackaWham","0","Hello,\n\nI believe the Lab research speed upgrades are not being applied correctly, particularly the level 2 upgrade.  My understanding is that level 1 provides 20% reduction on the timed cycles of each science pack.  Level 2 provides 30% with each subsequent upgrade being cumulative to the existing.  With this in mind my understanding is that research speed level 1 and 2 should provide a 50% reduction to the total cycle time?   [please let me know if I'm misunderstanding the way in which this is calculated]\n\n[B]REPLICATION:[\/B]\nWith Lab research speed 2 applied, I timed a 30s cycle technology (electric energy distribution 1) with 50% cumulative bonus at ~20s.  Is this not supposed to be 15s?  When timing the first upgrade (20%) I timed a 30s cycle tech at ~25s which still appears off but is a lot closer to my calculation of 24s.  I'm new to this game so I haven't achieved the other upgrades to test further so please excuse my limited data and misunderstanding if any.\n\n[B]ANSWER:[\/B]\nI just found this page and the calculations hold up answering my query and revealing that there is no bug but behaving as intended.  For those interested I will post some information and the wiki page link below:\n\nCalculation is [u]not[\/u] a direct percentage of the cycle time for each science pack unit as I was originally thinking but follows the following formula:\n\nT = (T[0] x P) \/ (L x S)\n\nT = total cycle time\nT[0] = standard time (in seconds) per cycle (listed on technology)\nP = number of science pack units\nL = number of labs\nS = speed modification provided by research and\/or modules, which is calculated by\n(1 + B[r]) x (1 + M[r])\n\nSo to plug in my above problem, I have:\n\n1 x Lab\nLevel 2 Lab research speed researched\nNo modules installed\n\nResearching Electric energy distribution 1 = 120 automation + logistic science packs @ 30s cycles.  First I need to calculate the speed modifications which I only have research which is giving me 50%.\n\n50 \/ 100 = 0.5\n\nNow plug that into the speed modification formula:   (1 + B[r]) x (1 + M[r])\n(1 + 0.5) x (1 + 0) = 1.5\n\nNow plug my speed modification into the main time formula:   T = (T[0] x P) \/ (L x S)\nT = (30s x 120) \/ (1 x 1.5)\n\nThis formula equals to 2400 which if you divide by \""P\"" again will give you your actual cycle time in seconds:\n\n2400 \/ 120 = 20s\n\n[url]https:\/\/wiki.factorio.com\/Research#:~:text=Unlike%20most%20bonus%20effects%2C%20the,are%20additive%20with%20each%20other.[\/url]\n\nGame log and version below - my apologies that the steam version seems to be a couple of versions earlier than the latest posted on your website.

"Factorio","Sandbox","UI scale bug on Steam Deck and other low resolution devices can render game permanently unplayable, requiring manual editing of config.ini","LordErec42","1","I was messing around with Factorio on my Steam Deck to see if it was playable and I encountered a really nasty UI bug that basically renders the game unplayable permanently until a persistent config file is edited. Uninstalling and reinstalling the game will not fix the issue as the config file is stored in a hidden folder in the users's OS profile completely outside the game.\n\nThe resolution scale UI setting can make the UI so large on low resolution devices that buttons, including the critical \""accept new settings button\"" are rendered off screen and there is no way to mouse over to change any additional settings if a user accidentally sets the UI scale too large.\n\nThe only fallback at this point is to manually navigate to this hidden file (extra annoying on the Steam Deck but at least it's possible) and either delete the file completely or edit the scale in the file.\n\nCan the UI render code be updated to handle this edge case and allow the settings menu in game to be functional enough to reset this back without needing to resort to external fixes?","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3803901366001311137/","12/01/2024 11:17:24","bug report"

This is 2 different bugs:\n\na) The game doesn't have any reason to check Steam's storage (because \""cloud saves\"" is disabled and has always been disabled), and is attempting to obtain information about my usage of steam against my will for no reason.\n\nb) The \""21 MB\"" is also wrong. My Steam Storage is almost empty. I checked via. https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/account\/remotestorage as I was worried malware had filled up my cloud storage somehow.\n\nI don't know when these bugs began - I've been playing other games for the last 6 months or so and returned to Factorio yesterday. I assume the first bug has always existed (you wouldn't know without logging network activity during game startup). Web searches show a few other people have mentioned the second bug on Steam and on Factorio's forum, but there's no resolution (it was assumed to be Steam's fault) and doesn't seem like a wide-spread problem.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/5769714637090413256/","12/01/2024 11:17:52","bug report"

Retries during that biggy time period just keep failing, pointing towards a likely server or communication channel issue.\n\nI contacted the developer and they said that they basically do nothing for Steam Cloud syncs, that Steam knows the folder and does everything on its own from that info.\n\nAny informatiin, solutions or band-aids would be greatly welcome.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3765608282421280525/","12/01/2024 11:19:34","bug report"

"Factorio","Sandbox","Repair pack bug","Tristan_3D","0","There is a bug, when you use the repair pack (or try to anyway). You pull out the repair pack, hover over the object to be repaired, click, and the repair pack just vanishes back into your inventory and nothing is repaired.\n\nThis is not how it's supposed to work. Usually, you pull out the pack, hover over the damaged object in close proximity, then left click, hold, and wait until the object is repaired. I did that like a thousand times already, but now it bugs out.\n\nWith a little experimentation, I found out: When you put the repair pack into your shortcut slot (1 or 2), then open your inventory, grab the pack, hover over the damaged object while your inventory is still open, holding left mouse button then close the inventory, the object repairs normally (you hear the usual whirling sound from the repair operation). That is the only way to repair an object for me right now.\n\nIt's not a mod problem. I deinstalled all mods, started a new standard free mode game, shot an object so it needs repairing, made a repair pack and it has the same bug (only workaround is the shortcut thing I described above).\n\nI have no idea what causes this or how to repair this bug.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3734078642262061018/","12/01/2024 11:19:54","bug report"

The issue is only with Factorio, all the other games i have work fine. The game launches and runs fine till it crashes, and there's nothing consistently happening when it crashes. The crashes are a full computer crash, not just a crash to desktop, and typically it's a freeze, followed by an automatic restart but it has been a Windows blue error screen a couple times. Also I have a pretty powerful computer, so there shouldn't be any issues with running the game. I've tried restarting my computer, verifying the integrity of the files, uninstalling and reinstalling, closing all apps i had running in the background, and adjusting the in game settings. I don't have any mods installed either.

Running Vanilla with no mods.
Running Windows 7.


All sound has just disappeared ingame. Getting no sound when switching sound settings until I try to switch the new sound device source setting. The sound comes back and then disappers again after 5 seconds. Then I'm back to square one.


Have tried the following stuff, but with no luck.

- Verified game files in Steam.
- Delete the config.ini folder by going into the %AppData% folder.
- Uninstall the game from Steam.
- Delete the %appdata%\Factorio folder.
- Delete the Steam\SteamApps\common\Factorio folder.
- Reboot PC.
- Reinstall Factorio from Steam.

Need help to figure this out.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3600093929973579136/","12/01/2024 11:19:59","bug report"

The only thing that's changed in that time was that I updated to the 526.98 drivers from Nvidia. FPS has decreased by 90% yet UPS is still rock steady at 57.

It doesn't happen every time I tab out but it does happen quite often and is very annoying because I basically have to wait for the game to auto save so I can restart it. The game does not freeze. Everything runs like normal, it just doesn't seem to take any input from my mouse or keyboard.

I recently purchased a Steam Deck and tried playing Factorio on it as well. After tweaking the controller bindings, I found it to be a great experience until I returned to my desktop PC. The controller bindings that I remapped on the Steam Deck overwrote the keyboard bindings when I returned to my PC. I had to remap all of my keyboard bindings on the PC before I could return to playing Factorio on the PC.\n\nIt appears as if Factorio uploads my controller bindings to the cloud that I also used for syncing my shared games.

"Factorio","Sandbox","Odd crash w/ modded game, possibly related to logging?","petermax","0","I was able to fix the problem I had, sort of, but the way I was able to fix it is weird enough that I thought I should post about it here.\n\nGame started failing to load after I accidentally reset graphics settings to default after a more normal crash (accidentally ran a second graphics-intensive program at the same time, ran out of video memory). After restarting, was consistently getting a BSOD on loading the game while building sprites, after the parallel sprite loader is initialized according to the logs. Standard igfx page fault crash, so did the tired old update-graphics-drivers-and-reinstall-everything with no success. Moved on to looking at configuration options, tried launching game forcing opengl (same result) and direct3D, which instead crashed 'properly', at the same stage, with an apparently generic error (SymGetLineFromAddr64, error code 487) happening in CreateDirect3D11SurfaceFromDXGISurface. Finally tried enabling verbose logging to see if that revealed any more information, leaving direct3D forced, and the game loaded successfully. At the point in the log where the crash had been happening, there were now a set of warnings about mipmap levels in sprites. Given that verbose logging somehow fixed the issue, my only guess is that somehow there's a logging function that accesses data differently depending on whether or not verbose logging is enabled, and if it isn't it has a risk of causing a page fault or something.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/5875531492233550842/","12/01/2024 11:20:23","bug report"

I have tried closing the game and opening again, verifying install, restarting steam multiple times, logging out of steam and back in. Nothing has worked.

"Factorio","Sandbox","Evolution and updating biters","nBow","2","Can anyone speak on how Factorio updates biters when evolution is increased? Because my friends and I have been playing on a server, and the more we explore\/biters that exist in our world the slower I become on the server, because I have a lower end PC. But I noticed while he was killing biters and I was logging in the catch up method would go backwards by a lot, and we've been trying to find out why my PC is having such an issue with FPS and UPS, finally I asked him to \/kill all biters in the world, and once he did this everything on my end maxed out. Which to me shows that the game is updating each entity the moment evolution increases. I feel like if this is the case that method should be changed in the base code to only update biters when they're about to interact with a player, so if they are coming within a certain distance of something I built to destroy it or within me or someone else as a player that's when their evolution should be applied to them, rather than as it happens. I think if this was how it worked, there wouldn't be the type of performance drop I faced. We have it in peaceful now and I'm not experiencing any issues.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3276941718977195035/","12/01/2024 11:21:09","bug report"

And so far it looks like it worked.\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n1: Ensured cloud sync was enabled on the Steam app under Steam-Settings- Cloud- tick Enable Steam Cloud synchronisation for applications which support it.\n2: Backup your save files in C:\\Users\\your user name\\AppData\\Roaming\\Factorio\\saves\\\n3: Go to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\22094142\\427520\\ and delete the remote folder and remotecache.vdf.\n4: Synced the save game data.\n5: Put back all the save files.\n6: Synced again as I pressed play.\n\nThe 427520 folder, according to a google search, is where the cloud data is stored, I'm sorry if I'm wrong there, just following a tutorial I found on the second link when I typed \""steam delete cloud saves\"", but afterwards I played for a bit and saved a few times to see if it was working and so far so good.\n\nDecided to post this as I haven't found anyone trying these steps to solve this problem.\nMaybe my google skills aren't the best and that would explain it, but like me there might be other people out there with average search skills, so I hope this helps.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/5/3276941086755193323/","12/01/2024 11:21:22","bug report"
