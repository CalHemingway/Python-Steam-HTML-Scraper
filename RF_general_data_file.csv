Continual immersion breakers,Meta03,3,"As much as I enjoy this game, it is more of a love\/hate kind of relationship and that for one reason. The weapon gambling gimmick, Borderlands wannabe mask. I can have such an amazing experience here for a time, even an hour, yet daily I end up rage quitting for same reasons. Having only 3 weapon slots...\nI loved these kinds of games since Thief TDP, Dishonored, Prey, as the immersion is the star of the show. I SO want it to be the same in Redfall, as there is so much going for this game, yet I continually get yanked out of the immersion because I need to keep switching my weapons around and often find myself in a surprise ambush by something I do not have a proper weapon equipped, and switching usually gets me quickly killed, and this after over 100 hours gameplay, I should be a pro. It feels like the monsters are getting stronger and I continually lag behind and have to roll for weapons just to have a more pleasant experience and not get killed every few minutes, and this on easiest difficulty.\nI play games to relax, I get more than enough anxiety and stress from real life, and I can relax to a game like Thief Gold, or Dishonored and I can feel like a god there, like I earned my way to rule, I can feel zen, instead of continually struggling with no way out but quitting.\nI guess it IS supposed to feel like a nightmare...",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1294810/discussions/0/4027969376953936469/

Gave it time to cook and now...,Casus,27,"I really enjoy it.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI'm a fan of Arkane games, though not what you would call a mega-fan. I've enjoyed everything they've done since Arx - but only a handful have been what I consider truly great. In fact, I think only Prey and perhaps Dishonored 2 take that honor for me, personally.\n\nAnyway, I loved the concept of Redfall - and I happen to really have fun with most co-op looters - especially if there's an interesting setting and story involved. Redfall, to me, always seemed like it would be ideal for a good time.\n\nSo... Launch happens - and I tried the Gamepass version, just to make sure.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. In fact, it was so bad that I stopped playing after only 30 minutes or so - and I was highly sceptical it would ever improve enough to be worth my time.\n\nThen, after the first patch - I gave it another shot and actually felt it was a pretty decent step up in overall quality. Still quite a ways from being a \""good game\"" - but at least the concept was more or less proven.\n\nI liked it enough to buy it on Steam. Not with the intention of playing it right away, but simply because I wanted to support the game - knowing how terrible the launch sales must have been.\n\nI felt like it still needed a couple more patches to be truly worthwhile.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nI have to say that this patch is pretty much everything I hoped for - barring some kind of miracle content drop.\n\nThey fixed all my major complaints, including:\n\nVacant town with way too few enemies.\nSubpar performance with significant traversal stutters.\nLack of challenge due to terrible AI and pathing.\nAn almost unbelievable lack of a proper stealth takedown mechanic.\nOverall lack of polish and too many visual glitches.\n\nYes, it's now in what I would call an acceptable, even decent, launch state.\n\nBased on a handful of hours with this new patch, I'm ready to give this game a solid 7.5\/10 - and potentially even higher if played with friends.\n\nI doubt it will experience the kind of redemption arc that other games have in recent times, but I certainly hope more people will try it and give it the attention I truly believe it now deserves.\n\nIt's an original setting and it smacks of games like Secret World and movies like Lost boys. It has a bit of Fallout, a bit of Destiny and more than a bit of all the great Arkane games that we've come to appreciate over the years.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1294810/discussions/0/3877093932384285593/

To the developers,JokersUAV,16,I know things look grim on player count but there is a lot of game releases currently . I appreciate that continue to support the game. As I do play it and actually really enjoy the game. I was one of the few who loved death stranding when it was considered a walking sim and everyone hated it. Now it's a classic.  I realize the game was not what people were expecting and in turned caused disappointment but really there are plenty of people that are like me and we'll find enjoyment in this game. They probably just haven't tried it yet.  So I hope you continue to support this as long as you can. I only wish more people would give it a chance.

Chill...,DezertPunK,9,Everyone has been overreacting about so many dumb things in the world and now it seems freaking video games are part of that. Hype plus too much time in front of a screen is driving everyone crazy.\nRedfall isn't goty but omg it isn't nearly as bad as you people are making it out to be. I'm playing at 30fps on console and still having fun. If this was developed in house at Bethesda everyone would defend the bugs.\nI'm not saying anyone should pretend to like something they don't but it's painfully obvious most are just parroting what you tubers are saying instead of giving it a real chance while you tubers are just parroting each other to get views because unfortunately trashing Redfall will get them more views than just saying it's a little above average with some bugs at launch that were clearly going to be fixed.\nThe environments are some of the best I've ever seen in a game. The amount of creativity that went into level design is phenomenal.\nNpc's aren't amazing but if you really can't stand fetch quests then what are doing doing playing this. It was never going to have Witcher level quests and dialogue which was obvious by the way they promoted it. They were 100% honest about what kind of game it would be so to complain about things like that is childish and unfair.\nJust chill and try not to get so worked up about little things like games. Instead of buying every new one that comes out try finishing some of the ones in your backlog and go outside more often. In the long run it'll help you and the gaming industry both since there won't be so much unneeded negativity everywhere.

NEW PATCH INSIGHT **CLICK HERE NOW**,Tasso,4,"I personally tried the new patch and its very good... Ish?~ Prior to this update I was getting sub 20 fps drops when moving around the game world every couple seconds on my 10900K \/ RTX 4080 configuration. This was a heavy CPU bottleneck due to the developers not understanding how to use UNREAL ENGINE 4 properly. \n\nHowever I can report that the game has improved significantly. Framerate is pretty much locked at my monitors refresh rate of 60. However some framedrops related to traversal are still there, with frametimes dropping to 60-100MS. This causes very harsh fps drops for a split second when entering a new traversal zone.\n\nI have also observed a striking increase to VIDEO MEMORY. With the settings maxed out prior to this my GPU was using 9GB of video memory. However as of the latest patch the VRAM usage is at 14GB @ 4K resolution, MAX graphics, DLAA.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1294810/discussions/0/3877093932381791660/

But i'd love to see a risk v reward system where the longer you stay out the more dangerous the world gets but also the better the drops are.\n\nYou would then have various objectives to achieve before night fall.

You can turn around and run back and forth over the area that produced it and nothing, lending me to believe it's not to do with crossing over an area and loading in another.

In that short time frame?\n\n-My framerate and graphical fidelity were both immediately and significantly worse.\n\n-I got an infinite loading screen almost immediately. Weirdly, I never got those BEFORE they claimed to fix them.\n\n-Rook Storm meter failed to increase upon nest completion.\n\n-Rook failed to drop any loot upon defeat.\n\n-Ammo reserves lowered\/vanished for weapons I wasn't using. My pals noticed the same because  the devs just reduced the amount of stake launcher ammo you can carry and didn't mention it in the official patch notes. Because that's a cool thing to do.\n\nEnemy names and health bars failed to appear for my buddies until they were within Shotgun range.\n\nIn the interest of fairness, the enemy increase was nice. Some of the new lighting and effects were nice. At one point there were like...20 cultists fighting one another. That's like...the only big positive. It's just frustrating to see a game release broken, have the developers go completely silent, then spring up with a patch that's impressive on paper and  worse in execution. I've given this game a lot of lukewarm defense, but I'm absolutely putting it down until I see a ton of new updates. How embarrassing for Arkane Austin, and absolutely terrible for people that actually paid $70 for this.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1294810/discussions/0/3816285189350417248/
AI updated and more enemies with this patch? Something tells me this is a lie,¬£ Me David,4,Myself and a couple of others got excited about getting back on this game with the thought that enemies would at least be somewhat more fun to fight against and would be more abundant.\n\nClearly not. 33GB patch for no changes to anything in the game and the same bugs still running rampant.,https://steamcommunity.com/app/1294810/discussions/0/3818536889301094191/
