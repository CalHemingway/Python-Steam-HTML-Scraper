I'm done.,Coupec,15,"Ok so I just changed my review to positive but will now be changing it back and wont be touching it again. \n\nTrading is still very very broken I've taken screenshots to show this. I'm still having a huge problem with hearses not doing anything no matter how many there are and low density residence need is a joke, there is just never enough land for it and I cant get the need down no matter what I do, I need high density but cant seem to get it just low. A good fix in my eyes for this problem would simply be adding a changeable tax for the zone size which I'd hope would have an impacted on zone demand. \n\nI completely understand the simulation we were told we would be getting, I understand the systems, this is not that or its very very broken. It is not my lack of understanding either before that is thrown at me, it is simply not there or broken. after seeing what the Total War team has done because of how bad their stuff got I feel you guys honestly should be doing the same, you've released a completely unready product and even gone so far as be offensive to your customers, you need to fix it or it'll cost you in the long run I can tell you. For this player at least, I wont be supporting  you any longer unless there are some crazy turn around which I just don't see happening but if you keep making these mistakes without putting them right the damage that will be done will be huge.\n\nYour company relies on customer loyalty because of the huge amounts of DLC you make  for your games, what you've done here has the potential to destroy that model going forward. Why would anyone be loyal and buy in for your DLC if you couldn't even get the base game right or fixed in a timely manner? \n\nThis sim is just broken and now I give up can't be asked and won't be buying into this again moving forward. Stellaris will be my last from anyone involved with Paradox, once support for that ends I'm staying away from your company and I'd suggest to others to do the same.

'WHY?' questions about the game in its current state,Pain,38,"As someone with over 2000 hours in Cities 1 \u02d0BR_Skull\u02d0, I'd like this to be kind of a rant but also to point out the stupidity with some of the choices made for this game, but also to introduce people interested in the game to the multifold of problems you may encounter while trying to enjoy playing this mess.\n\nWHY does the game cause traffic out of nowhere, you can literally have a perfect road system and the perfect interchanges\/sections yet the traffic will choose to drive through the worst roads\/paths imagineable. You have traffic on the highway merging into eachother for NO reason whatsoever, often even doing 90 degree lane switches or even doing U-turns on national roads. My entire city have bottlenecks that are literally unsolvable because the traffic cannot behave realistically on any type of road.\n\nWHY does the traffic not follow the restrictions i set? I can ban turning left and right on a road and the cars will STILL be turning left and right totally ignoring a yes\/no programming which im assuming the restrictions do. The cars will also totally ignore bus lanes and use them like normal roads, even roads which function as BRTs for busses. \n\nWHY do bus stops have to take up an entire node? Ive never in my life seen a bus pocket as big as the game can create, there is no easy solution to fix this except connect a road or crosswalk to shorten the node, it looks really stupid and the first game got it righ first try. Tram stops suffer from the exact same issue too instead of just creating stops which fit their length. Lets not even mention have you cannot connect paths to tram-only tracks nicely and they ALWAYS look bugged.\n\nWHY do pedestrians walk on highways and cross on intersections with banned crosswalks, i don't mind having one person in a while do this, but ive seen literal hordes of people talk pilgrimages along highways (which do not really connect to anything important) and people running over very busy intersections without crosswalks. Same question goes to why pedestrians can stop taxis on the middle of a highway.\n\nWHY is there no smaller train stations, the default one is literally a huge city station which cannot be downgraded even though upgrading buildings has been such a big deal, why give us a default 6 track station in that case if it could be a single track station you could upgrade depending on what you need. For metros id like to know why there isn't any elevated ground station, ive never seen a ground-level station like the game has now. \n\nWHY is building quays literally impossible? The game will complain about too much or too little water and the only way to build them is through some trickery with the terrain, why is there simply not an option to FORCE quays to be built and FORCE roads to be straight. Even if you do master building quays they will still not be straight because the game loves to make random bumps and hills. \n\nWHY do rescue and police helicopters land infront of peoples houses? and why does building helicopter infrastructure replace ambulances and police cars. If you add helicopters to your hospital or police station you will 90% of the time see them going out to emergencies instead of ambulances or police cars. Also as opposed to the previous games the helicopters simply ghost through buildings. \n\nWHY can you not place bus\/taxi lanes on whichever lane you want, what if i don't want my outermost lanes to be the bus lanes but the innermost ones? The only way to do this is make avenues with single roads and rely on meganodes, which do not function like inteded with the traffic lights.\n\nWHY do tunnels create a dip in the terrain before turning into an actual tunnel in the case of building a tunnel which goes down into the ground, i haven't found a solution to that, same goes for both rail and road tunnels. There is also no good way to create tunnels in general where the terrain will push the roads up for no reason. With bridges you can atleast force them to start as a full-on bridge by creating a crater right before the road turns into a bridge.\n\nWHY do bridges get so few pillars\/supports? Sometimes you might get lucky and be able to place a few pillars by double-clicking them but often you're left with extremely unrealistic bridges that defy all laws of physics. The same goes for all kinds of bridges except roads over other roads, but those have the issue of not letting you delete them after placing and force you to destroy the entire road (both the bottom and top one) until it lets you delete the section you want to\n\nWHY do farms and industry buildings spawn random buildings in the fields with no road connections and completely ignoring the terrain they spawn on making ugly hills. Not only does this look like \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, it also serves no function. Same thing could be said about the variety of farms, its all just one ugly brownish yellow blob if you have a big farming area (tbh, same goes for all the industries, but the agriculture is less excuseable). \n\nWHY does water have zero real physics compared to the last game? working with water is extremely infuriating and really hard to get rid of if you want to do some land reclamation, back to the quays, building and industrial area next to the water makes you want to smash your keyboard against the wall. Getting rid of poop-water is basically impossible as the game has no filtering systems like the previous game did. \n\nWHY does the game have a complete lack of biking infrastructure? Actually i do know why, to sell us another stupid DLC that focuses on that even though the previous game already had the biking problem solved, implementing it into this game would not take them any real effort. Same goes for lack of monorails, cable cars or even stupid things like trolleybusses, which made their way into C:S1 at a very late stage. \n\nWHY does public transport not allow you to have LESS vehicles than the game forces you to have, what if i only want two busses on my rural bus line, but the game will force you to have like 10+ if you have too many stops, and there is a limit to how FEW vehicles you can have, it makes no sense and i see no reason this is a feature. Also being able to choose if public busses should stop on every stop or skip it if there is no one waiting should be up to the player, ive had instances where busses pile up at the bus terminals because they all come back empty and it takes a good while for them to unbunch again. \n\nI could mention like 50 more things, but i feel like at this point ive pointed out enough \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 for today, i really hope the developers intend to fix alot of the issues people have been complaining, but seeing how Cities Skylines has an almost monopoly on games like these, i have really low hopes like i did with the last game.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031346899449226999/

"Just going to leave this here, people take note.",Coupec,1,"A MESSAGE FROM TOTAL WAR\u2019S LEADERSHIP TEAM\nTOTAL WAR\nTotal War\nDecember 14 2023\nDear Total War fans,\n\nI\u2019m Roger Collum, Vice President at Creative Assembly, and writing on behalf of our Total War leadership team.\n\nIt has been a difficult few months, and we recognize that we have made mistakes when it comes to our relationship with you all. It\u2019s been a constant conversation internally on how we can get back to solid ground. What\u2019s clear is that it won\u2019t be easy and that it will take time and effort.\n\nWe see the confusion, the frustration, and the distrust of us across the community and honestly, it breaks our hearts. We make games to bring you joy, to inspire a love of history, of fantasy, and strategy games. Total War is our everything, we care about it as deeply as you. Recently, it\u2019s clear that we have failed to demonstrate that in our actions.\n\nWe are sorry.\n\nWe cannot fix our issues overnight, but we will work towards a more transparent, and consistent relationship with you all.\n\nTotal War is a big and complex ship to steer, built on decades of knowledge, passion and technology. The slow and steady pace we\u2019ve taken up till now has benefited us in the past, but today we see the need to react faster to help address the challenges that are ahead of us.\n\nSo, let\u2019s talk about those challenges, and what you can expect from both Total War: WARHAMMER III, and Total War: PHARAOH going forward.\n\nTOTAL WAR: WARHAMMER III\nWe have listened to your feedback on Shadows of Change and we know that we failed to meet your expectations of what a DLC should be. To address that, we are enhancing our offer for everyone who purchased Shadows of Change with more content and a commitment to ensuring that we better meet your expectations going forward.\n\nWe\u2019re targeting a major update to Shadows of Change which will arrive free for everyone who owns it. We have the goal of releasing this update in February 2024, at which point it will become part of the package for everyone who buys it in the future.\n\nThat launch date is our ambition, but this isn\u2019t concrete. It may move, and as soon as those plans are finalised, we\u2019ll let you know and we\u2019ll keep you in the know as we get closer to its release.\n\nWhen we return in the new year, you\u2019ll hear directly from Game Director Richard Aldridge and the WARHAMMER III team who will start to talk to you about what this expansion to Shadows of Change will look like.\n\nMaking this right is important to us, and to do this properly, Thrones of Decay will move out of its intended release window of Winter 2023. We\u2019re looking to launch this DLC in April 2024.\n\nWe also have more work to do on Thrones of Decay to make sure that we don\u2019t repeat our past mistakes, and to give you the amount of content that you rightly expect from us at these price points. Once we\u2019ve launched our free update to Shadows of Change, we\u2019ll talk more about what this next DLC will offer and how it will add to your experiences of WARHAMMER III. We\u2019ll make sure that you know exactly what\u2019s coming in Thrones of Decay before pre-orders are available, and make sure that you have full transparency around the content before you see \u2018Buy Now\u2019 buttons.\n\nAfter Thrones of Decay releases, we\u2019ll reveal what the next series of content for WARHAMMER III looks like. Our work on this beloved series isn\u2019t finished yet.\n\nSince 4.0 went live, we\u2019ve changed up how we approach making updates to the game, releasing 10 hotfixes, as well as Patch 4.1, all targeting issues that we\u2019ve seen emerging after each subsequent update, as well as introducing new features like Skill Point resets that help balance and improve the core experience of playing the game.\n\nIt\u2019s an increase in the number of game updates that we\u2019d usually release, and we want to keep this cadence of releases going forward. We can\u2019t commit to a fixed number of updates each month, as we\u2019ll ultimately release these based on the content that we\u2019re building, and the issues we see you raising that need our attention. However, over these last few months, we\u2019ve released a game update roughly every two weeks and where we can, we\u2019d like to stick to that through 2024.\n\nTOTAL WAR: PHARAOH\nWe want to make you aware of a decision that we\u2019ve made internally surrounding the game, and what to expect with the DLC that we\u2019ve been working on. There\u2019s some important information here that affects all owners of the game so please read through this part carefully.\n\nIn the next few days, all current owners of Total War: PHARAOH will see that Steam has processed a partial refund to you, and that some funds have been added to your Steam Wallet. This is happening because we have lowered the price of the game to a new RRP of $39.99\/\u20ac39.99\/\u00a329.99. (Find out more about this process here)\n\nWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that our fans, who put their trust in us on PHARAOH, should in any way feel disadvantaged for buying the game at the previous price. We\u2019ve also removed the higher priced editions of the game, the Deluxe Edition, and Dynasty Edition. There\u2019s now only one edition of the game available for purchase.\n\nOur next update, and what was originally our first paid DLC will release early in 2024 as a free update for everyone who owns the game. We\u2019ll have plenty to show you about this now free addition to PHARAOH in the new year.\n\nWe have now begun the process of reassessing what comes next for PHARAOH, and while we don\u2019t have all the answers today, we want to make it clear to you that we\u2019re not closing the door on other, more ambitious updates to the game in the future. We\u2019ve still got big plans, but we want to be honest with you in saying that we need to spend more time with them before putting them out on show.\n\nWhilst we have removed the Dynasty Edition of the game from our lineup and have internally changed up our plans for what we go on to do next, we\u2019ll still be releasing incremental updates to the game that help to bring fixes and changes to the core experience along the way. One plan that we\u2019ve always had since the early stages of development on PHARAOH is to expand the size of our campaign map as a free update, and to introduce even more factions and cultures to the game. We\u2019ll have more to say, and to show, what that looks like in the new year after our next update for PHARAOH releases.\n\nWe\u2019re very proud of our teammates, and grateful to all the players who picked up PHARAOH. To those players, the team are forever reading all your comments and feedback, with the goal of bringing you future fixes and changes that catch us up on the things that we\u2019ve missed.\n\nBefore we sign off from today\u2019s blog, we\u2019re going to talk about how we can include more of your voices in what we do. We want to expose more of what we do behind the scenes.\n\nOur goal is to invest more in our player channels moving forward, introducing more voices from the studio who can speak to you directly about their work and how that relates to what you want from our titles, and most importantly to keep listening to your feedback. This will all be a work in progress, so do bear with us, but this is our direction moving forward.\n\nWe again apologise for the missteps we\u2019ve made. The mistakes of Total War are a shared responsibility by all the leaders of the franchise, and while it may not seem like it at times, we are listening. We really hope that the extra love we\u2019re pouring into WARHAMMER III DLC, our several recent updates, and the changes for PHARAOH show our heartfelt commitment to these games and to you.\n\nWe know we have a lot of work to do, and that this one letter doesn\u2019t amount to any proof of the future. You\u2019ll need to see the change before you believe it. You will hear from us again on the changes coming to Shadows of Change, and on what to expect for PHARAOH when we return from the holidays, and you\u2019ll continue to hear from us on the Total War leadership team once we\u2019ve settled back into the flow of the new year and we\u2019ll keep bringing you more news on where we\u2019re at.\n\nWhere we make mistakes in this next part of our journey, we\u2019ll work hard to act faster to address them, to iterate whilst we learn from those moments, and to always be taking steps in the right directions. We hope that you can find patience for us as we find our footing again, and we hope in the coming months we can prove to you with actions along with words.\n\nWe hope you all enjoy a peaceful holiday. Thank you for being with us in 2023, for sharing with us in your love of Total War. We\u2019ll see you in 2024.\n\nHappy Holidays,\n\nRoger, and the Total War leadership team",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4041481833163320365/

Waiting for the 2024 update,MNMN,0," Cities 2 is an attractive game. I think it gives you a little fun watching the city grow.\nHowever, it is true that there are still some regrets, and I am going to write down the personal discomforts I have felt while waiting for 24 years.\n\n1. Transportation\n- There is still a crowding phenomenon on buses, and recently I saw that there is also a crowding phenomenon on the subway. The subway is a system that operates at regular intervals by maintaining distance even when there are no customers at the station, right? I hope an efficient vehicle distance maintenance system is introduced quickly.\n- Since the movement route is not visible, it is not easy to resolve if the road is blocked, whether due to new residents or cargo. I think this is a really necessary UI. I hope it is introduced in 2024.\n- We are waiting for the introduction of subway transfer stations. If there are cross transfer stations and parallel transfer stations, it will be possible to build efficient public transportation through a transfer system between multiple lines.\n- I hope the names of the installed stations will be linked to the subway and bus routes. The names are not linked, so it is impossible to intuitively check which stations the demand is concentrated in. In Cities 1, if you change the name of the subway station, it will be reflected on the route map immediately, making it easier to recognize.\n- In City 1, if you choose the subway, you can visually see how many people are in the station because it is painted in the color of the line, but not in City 2. In particular, in the case of City 2, the distinction between the ground and the underground is not clear, so it looks visually overlapping, hurts your eyes, and is not intuitive. I hope we can make a distinction between the ground and the underground, like when installing subway tracks, or change it so that we can distinguish it visually clearly, like in City 1.\n\n2. Modding and Asset\n- TMPE, IPT2, MOVE IT, etc. There are many modes, so City 1 was easy to manage. 2024..Looking forward to it :)\n- I'm also looking forward to asset!! I wish we could install a breakwater on the water and a retaining wall on the ground.\n-  I hope there will be a variety of unique buildings. I'll be waiting!\n\n3. Graphic\n- The car still looks like clay and I can see it returning to its original state and I believe it will be fixed soon.. or is it my graphics setup problem?\n- I'm not sure if it's my LOD setup problem but the car blinkers are causing the sunroof to sparkle as well. Depending on the angle, I can't see it, but hmmm.. is it my setup problem?\n- The water doesn't look that natural. It would have been nice if the dam had been installed and showed the flow. It would have been better if the moving water after the topography was modified was more natural. Should I raise it to high when the water quality option is medium?\n\n4. AI\n- As mentioned above, improved public transportation AI with maintained intercar distance...\n- It's just some reckless drivers who make a left turn while invading the centerline on a road that bans them from turning left, right? If so, I hope there's also a traffic cctv that fines them haha\n-  Don't change lanes right in front of the intersection, you yum chum drivers! The road is blocked!!!\n\n Most of the inconveniences are related to public transportation, transportation AI, visibility and intuition. I'm not sure except for some of the errors that break the graphic part. If it's about visibility and intuition when installing public transportation, it might be about graphics. Moding or assets will be released soon, so you can trust and wait, but I think the problems listed above are not enough compared to Citi 1, so I think they need to be improved.\n Of course, it's my personal opinion. I know that not all problems can be fixed in a short time. So, I hope that in 2024, City 2 will develop and become more fun. I'm looking forward to DLC!\nWell, I have to go now",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4041481833162179445/

I don't care so much that performance is lacking but it's also unstable - crashing frequently. (I think they're happening during (attempted) autosaves. I really like the mixed zoning and the transport depots but that's about it. The parks look like they were designed by the winner of a kindergarten contest. You are forced to build a certain type of residential. Why complicate it? Maybe my expectations were too high. I expected CS1 plus, instead it's a step down. I expected some of the top mods in CS1 to be incorporated - they aren't. No quays, no moveit!, no anything. You have to place stops for public transportation and then run the routes. The demand bars seem to have no correlation with actual demand. The perk tree makes no sense. Why would I invest points to decrease graduation rates by 1 or 2%? Why do I have to specify routes for cargo trains? There's more but all and all it looks like the game was developed with the idea that modders would make it right. They probably will but they've got their work cutout for them.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4029096764570674738/
GPU usage.,Briseti,12,"I have a 4090 in a solid build and i'm getting 95%+ GPU usage, causing my GPU heat to spike to above 90c.

I don't feel comfortable when i see the temps get close to 100c so Is this being looked at by the devs?  \n\nMy GPU is custom watercooled with an active backplate so cooling isn't an issue with virtually any other game I've ever played, including CPR and other high demand games.\n\nThanks for any input anyone may have.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4029096764568518407/

"At 135k population, things just....stopped",matt.pettitt,4,"Odd one this, performance was never awesome (3080 with Ryzen 9 5900X) but consistently got 30-40 on mediocre settings throughout (despite cput\/gfx never going much higher than 30\/40%) Then, all of a sudden, whilst moving a building, the fps dropped to less that 1FPS. What's odd is that despite changing the settings to the lowest of the low, the FPS remains the same. Reboot doesn't change anything, latest drivers, etc.\n\nSo it looks like to me, something in the game has just got itself in a knot - no matter what you, just moving around the screen - you can be waiting a couple of seconds for it to react.

Assuming I installed and saved the game with unofficial and unsupported mods, what happens in the future if I decide to uninstall them?

Traffic AI is still stupid,What a disaster,58,"I've seen several posts with people praising the improvements to the traffic AI, but I think they may just be confusing improvements with less overall traffic. I already have over 30 hours in the game and I am constantly noticing extremely stupid and frustrating traffic behaviour. For example, cars feel the need to cut across 3 lanes of traffic 5 meters before the intersection, when they had plenty of time to get in the correct lane, which backs up the whole street. There's cars doing 3 point turns on the middle of intersections. Some cars will take stupidly long out of the way routes to get where they are going, even when the optimal route has light or no traffic. Cars still drive down to the end of cul-de-sacs to turn around when they have already passed an intersection that they could have used to reach their destination. I feel like even with TMPE tools, I would have to spend a lot of time figuring out ways to deal with the traffic because the AI is just not very good.

Density Demand tips,jshutich,5,"I have been finding some interesting things regarding the low density housing. It all started when I did not have any low density demand after level 2. This was caused by 3 low density houses without any occupants. These houses did not look any different then any other low density house, in fact two were level 2+ houses. To find them I found you can select the happiness icon in the low right corner and then look for houses that are white or gray in color. BTW commercial will show up as white or gray as well so it is not a perfect way to find the houses but it was the best way I could find. Bulldoze the houses with zero occupants and I got the low density housing demand again.\n\nThis brings us to the placement of low density housing. I been seeing that low density housing hates the medium density housing with integrated commercial. The medium density housing with commercial will immediately turn the roads\/area red for low density. The standard medium density housing and commercial don't have the same problem but the low density is not wildly crazy about medium density housing either. I will say low density commercial and low density housing get along OK.\n\nFurther testing  and city development found my city missing medium density demand from about 30K until 90K. No demand, just high and low but no medium. I  found as many mix use medium density with built in commercial and deleted them. This kick started my medium  density demand and at 90K I see some, not a lot but at least I have some. \u02d0steamhappy\u02d0\n\nI think my next goal is to find and delete all the mixed use medium with commercial buildings.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031348273659593262/

Please fix the game !!!,fkeskin1,15,"stead of asking, you haven't fixed the game for 2 months.It's a shame you haven't been able to solve the primary school problem for 2 months. The game can't be played just for that reason. There is a problem of trained workers because of the bug in the game.The demand for primary schools is extremely high, It's a joke that we need to establish 100 200 primary schools. \n\nIt is very difficult to build roads on the sloping terrains in the game. Most of the time you cannot build a building next to the road. In the first game, the road easily adjusted its slope according to the slope of the road. It's pure torture in the second game. \n\nTraffic behavior is stupid. There were traffic routes in the 1st game, why aren't there any in the 2nd game?  \n\npost office vehicles do not go out to collect mail. Although there is a lack of service. And this reduces efficiency (mail processing minus 10 points). \nThere is a problem in the rock production industry, it always says zero. The livestock industry produces zero production on infertile lands. \nThe game lags even on the RTX 3070 TI system.

It's not just about poor performance, but in many places the new game is worse than the previous version - for example, you can't block the construction of skyscrapers (which was possible in the first version). As a result, we have single-story offices or skyscrapers several dozen stories high, and nothing in between. The road construction mechanism is irritating - too sensitive, and as a result, the slightest twitch of the hand causes the street to be poorly situated. What particularly irritates me is the mechanism for adding blocks - when I want to add a new street, the buildings on the opposite side are immediately destroyed. not to mention the fact that it is still impossible to build buildings on fields other than rectangular.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031348273656635974/

A Technical Explanation for Low Simulation Speed,mehmeteking,16,"This post's target audience is software developers.\n\nCities: Skylines 2 is a city simulation where the bulk of the work is simulating individual \""cims.\"" Depending on implementation there can be other agents like vehicles, etc; but the total number of simulation agents can be expected to scale linearly with city population. There are other active components in the game, but none of them do anything that is computationally expensive, at least not in scale.\n\nAgents mostly do nothing (something like 99.9...% of the time) they just wait at their home or their workplace; they have nothing to interact with. When an agent is active, the only thing they do is to travel somewhere, so practically the only \""decision\"" which may have any significant cost is navigation. Therefore, the simulation should be extremely light and sparse, esp. given that various routing algorithms (even just Dijkstra's) can make the cost of routing rather insignificant.\n\nAs things stand, even on modern machines the simulation already starts to slow down with tens of thousands of agents, let alone hundreds of thousands; though it runs as intended with low populations. So the bottleneck is definitely the simulation itself. This cannot be explained easily, as any modern machine should be able to run such a sparse simulation for tens of millions of agents without even breaking a sweat.\n\nThere can be several explanations for this, but one thing is certain: those who designed and implemented the simulation did not calculate whether their design actually satisfies requirements, or they miscalculated and didn't realize their mistake even as they implemented it. Unfortunately, this massive \""mistake\"" alone is enough to render the software a failure as it falls short of its basic requirements (promised to end-users.)\n\nMy guess is that the game is built on a deep simulation engine; i.e. agents remain active components even when they do nothing for several minutes of real world time. The Unity engine encourages a certain way of programming under the OOP paradigm, the developers likely went along with it hoping that everything will be fine.\n\nOOP is not really the most suitable paradigm to implement sparse simulations (or arguably any kind of simulation) for various reasons. For example encapsulating behavior requires separate function calls on each relevant agent where some behavior is simulated. This is a pathway to disaster esp. within an engine where each and every active component is already polled for actions repeatedly in high frequency.\n\nGiven how extremely light the simulation is, with no complex decision making except for navigation, the most suitable paradigm for this simulation would perhaps be FP which would also give parallelism for free. Agents can be passive components, or even represented by some simple ADT. Or; if there are some invisible reasons to implement a deep simulation (lot of state to keep track of?), the actor-model could have been picked for asynchronous programming so that idle components practically don't incur any computational cost. Note that if properly isolated, the actor-model also gives parallelism for \""free.\""\n\nIt is trivial to see that however the simulation is implemented, its computational cost per-\""cim\"" is higher than can possibly be justified. I hope the team re-evaluate their design, and implement a more effective solution. Otherwise I am afraid this game will face the same fate as SimCity 2013.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031347929700006128/

"Bugs and such aside, the fundamental flaw of this ""city builder""",rex_goodheart,9,"is that it REQUIRES you to be EVERYTHING in that city.  Not only do you have to plan the city, you must be the mayor, the power director, the garbage director, the power director, the tax collector, the transportation director, the fire safety director, the parks and recreation director, the health and disease director....  some of these functions are government jobs, some private...  but you have to do them all.\n\nI mean...  how is this any fun?  You might enjoy that level of detailed responsibility; I sure don't.  If I wanted to work so hard I wouldn't have retired in real life.  \n\nSo, here's the biggest problem in Cities Skylines:  if the basic supposition is that I'm the mayor then just like in real life I should be able to delegate, delegate, delegate those other jobs.  This game doesn't allow me to do that.  I MUST be the guy who places pipes on a map.\n\nSo, why not allow the game purchaser to choose which functions he wishes to actually control?  I don't want to deal with sewerage; I want to be the guy who allocates funds for garbage and sewer control and let those things be automatic.  That's what a mayor does.\n\nI like the artwork.  I like watching the cars and people and dogs of a simulated city.  I like planning out roads and bridges and where the airport's going to be.

Trucks are not sent out - garbage disposal is problematic,BluKa | Exelloco,0,"I have this strange issue with my garbage disposal. I haven't had any problems with traffic or any services in my city (approximately 100k inhabitants) for a long time. However, now I've created a downtown area with skyscrapers, high-density residentials, commerce, and office areas, and things are getting quite hectic. The traffic is extreme but flowing, although there are occasional jams.\n\nAfter a while, though, garbage piles have accumulated. When I noticed the problem, about 10k residents were affected, and I searched for the cause. The cause seems to be: the calculation of how many garbage trucks the recycling centers need to send out is incorrect. Currently, I have two recycling centers and one incineration plant. The incineration plant has sent out 14\/75 trucks, the recycling centers 2\/30 and 8\/30. All three are far from their capacity limits. One of the recycling centers explicitly covers only this downtown area. This is the center with 2\/30 trucks sent out. \n\nSinde in this area ever building has hundreds of residents, garbage trucks stop at towo of them and then have to return to the facility. If the Centers would just ONCE send out all of their trucks, this problem would be done with immediately\n\nI really do not know how to fix this. Building additional facilities does not solve the issue.  Does anyone have the same issue - or a workaround?",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031347532808072303/

"So, just copying the Traffic Manager Mod was no Option?",Bambusbjörn,12,"I guess everyone that played CS1 knows about the Traffic Manager:Presidential Edition-Mod. A Mod on such a high Standard it seemed to be Dev-made. Added about 300% playability to the game and the Designer should have gotten some kind of Medal.\n\nNow CS2 is here and what is the greatest Problem with my traffic? It's not the cars..or the trucks...or the endless fleet of emergency services from other cities even though i have enough capacity with my own..it's the pedestrians.\n\nEvery intersection,every roundabout, the traffic just crawls. Why? Because of the endless flood of pedestrians. Would be ok, i mean, there ARE a lot of pedestrians in cities, and i have a bunch of ideas how i could fix the problem. Let's list a few:\n\n-Pedestrian Over\/Underpasses. Too bad i can't build those in a reasonable shape or dimensions. Plus, they prefer jaywalking anyways.\n\n-A more complex traffic light setting suitable for larger Intersections with much foottraffic. Too bad all i can do is \""Lights\/no Lights\"".\n\n-Forbid crossing on certain intersections all together. I can delete the crosswalks buuuut: Nobody cares, they just jaywalk anyways. Here in Europe, jaywalking isn't a thing and you are pretty much allowed to cross the street wherever you like. But i can tell you People do NOT cross 4-or more lane roads without crosswalks\/lights, for obvious reasons.\n\nWell..guess traffic jams it is then :) Oh and another thing:\n\nAre the cars driven by cats or sth? When there is a building that CAN be entered like a garage, a parking lot etc...they WILL. No reason. The routes not shorter, they don't need to park. They just can, so they do, and hinder traffic in the process.\n\nBottom line: Give us more complex options to control traffic!

Intel Arc A770 16GB plays better then Nvidia RTX 3070 8GB,enderbeta,4,"I have some other machines I have been testing. One is another i9-10900K with an AI 280mm cooler and a RTX 3070 Founders Edition. The other is a i9-11900K with a air cooler and an Arc A770 16GB Limited Edition.\n\nIt is interesting to note two things. The AIO i9-10900K with no overclocking maintains 1 minute of simulation time per second at the max speed in game. The i9-11900K on air with no overclocking is at 1 minute of simulation time per two seconds.\n\nThe other thing is the Arc A770 16GB doesn't have stuttering issues where the frame rate massively dips at times like the RTX 3070. I haven't compared the actual frame rates or gauged the average FPS to make any kind of statement, but in testing the Arc A770 16GB was not stuttering or jerking around graphically. \n\ni won't have time to swap the processors and see how the i9-11900K does in the AIO because that machine is selling at lunch time today but I might toss it in the triple 360mm water cooling loop to see.

If you have far more workplaces than available workers, you will eventually get those complaints. Chasing the demand meter is not the best way to play.

"Unnecessary ""depth to simulation"" maybe leading to performance issues?",aymantg,32,"As a software engineer\/architect myself, I wonder if some of the necessary \""depth\"" in game simulation can affect performance. For example, in the past there was a mod\/policy to remove pets which are simulated but have no affect on anything in the game. I'm not going to pretend like I understand how all the AI simulations work, but I would assume that if \""something\"" is being simulated (in this case I picked the example of pets) then it will affect performance (big or small). Cities Skylines 1 was awesome, but when it first game out it felt like a slow motion simulation until several patches later. Then it became more stable, fun etc etc.  \n\nI just finished playing Dyson's Sphere program which simulates an entire galaxy of things moving\/being mined\/produced etc. Never had one glitch or performance issue in a game that is technically still Early Access. Again, not going to say I fully understand game development, but as a person that works will data I understand that removing unnecessary lag (even if small) adds up as things scale. I'm also just bringing up this game not as a head to head comparison - as they are different - but to drive the point that it does best what it is supposed to do best which is simulation of production lines across a galaxy.\n\nAgain back to the pet example. If a city has 30,000 citizens and each citizen has a pet, won't the engine technically have additional work to do? Even though those aren't fully simulated like Cims? There should be options to remove some of the extra bloat items (another thread mentioned teeth for Cims were optimized - how about hair and other non-important items). It can be an option that can be turned on\/off in the game play settings or something. If folks want to keep it to \""enhance\"" their city and bring it to \""life\"" then let it be. \nI don't speak for everyone, but I prefer a simulation that is smooth and is not that slow over something that is gorgeous but at the expense of things that add no value (hence my examples).\n\nApologies for the length, I just wanted to make sure my point is fully understood. I hope the Devs read this, I loved the original Cities Skylines and hoping to love this. Thank you!",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/3937895635388714374/

We are looking into the bug reports related to the economy and also other parts of the simulation that tie into it and will fix those as we identify the causes. I'm not entirely sure how to respond to the accusations of the simulation being fake. It's in no means meant to simulate the real world as that would be far too complex to model for a game. All the citizens and businesses, their wealth and resources etc are calculated, we have no reason to lie in our dev diaries. It would be completely acceptable to fake numbers if it makes good gameplay and I for one would have no issue stating if that was the case.

When it comes to the gameplay and simulation we set goals for the game and we have reached those goals.\n\nSurely there are issues that we're looking into and fixing bugs, but the overall gameplay experience is what we aimed for. Cities: Skylines II is the better game compared to the first one. If you dislike the simulation, this game just might not be for you. If there is a bug that ruins it for you there's a good chance it's fixed sometime in the future. Games are a subjective experience and it is impossible to please everyone. There's a bugfixing patch on its way soon however, so hopefully we'll be able to resolve at least some of the issues that may be a deal breaker for some. We thank you for your patience!\n\nFor clarity the above is for the simulation and gameplay. The performance is not where we want it to be and we are hard at work to improve it. This is also the reason the consoles were delayed. The modding support is an important part of a Colossal Order game, so it will also be rolling out as soon as possible.\n\nWe are disappointed we couldn't make these aspects of the game ready for you on time, but we refuse to give up.

The game is a joke, designed ENTIRELY for maximising profit and meeting corporate profit forecasts, with zero consideration for quality, or for the typical expectations one would have when paying for a game as it was advertised to be. If Steam refunds took into account the complexity of local trading laws, I am certain the trading laws of the UK would guarantee a refund on this product because it has been very obviously mis-sold.\n\nThe fact that there are over 2000 bug reports on the Paradox forum in the first two weeks alone speaks volumes, and this is only worsened by the fact that these reports are from paying customers.

These devs and water,RobinhoodtheFletchling,3,"    I just need to ask, where on earth have these devs been modeling rivers and water. Why does every map have rivers that are 30+ meters deep and have oceans worth of water flowing through them every second. Why is the water modeled for this? It is just fundementally flawed, and i though basically everyone figuered that out from cities 1. Rivers look like lines that a child drew with their whole fist in a sandbox. Rivers are rarely more than a few meters deep. \n\n    The sense of scale is just so broken that it leads to so many problems the moment you try to touch them. I have had whole cities flood because I had to adjust a river slightly, or heaven forbid you try to make a damn dam. every time ive tried to make an even slightly realistic dam they end up overtopping because for some reason the devs though that  dams fill to the brim. There is no nuance in rivers in this game as of now, as they are just massive torrents of water that cant be effectively worked around in even slightly realistic ways... \n\n    If they wanted to make water actually interesting they should have tried to make water scale smaller, not bigger.  A map like mountain village should have cascading rapids with rivers with a depth measured in single digits and plunging foaming waterfalls. Instead we have the same 10% sloped mass of water like every other map... Its honestly just disappointing.

Possible cause of the cargo transportation issues,Rin,8,"I've been observing the game for a bit and I think I realized one of the main issues with cargo terminals which spirals out into other issues. While the wiki says companies can buy and sell at these which makes them act as distribution hubs, due to either an oversight or a bug the terminals can only export via their own trucks which is hard capped. For whatever reason the different companies cannot send trucks to the cargo station and pick them up, they will only send them there to drop off cargo. So if you build one in an industrial area you have to wait for one of the 12-16 trucks to pick up cargo and take it somewhere.\n\nThis leads to why the mail system tends to jam up. Because it has to rely on the trucks within the terminal for exporting that means that the trucks within places like the post sorting facilities cannot do anything to speed up the process. \n\nThis definitely feels like a bug and not part of the intended design because it seems silly that a postal sorting facility could not collect mail and instead has to wait on another truck to bring the mail to it.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031347072448117383/

Game reminds me a lot of Simcity 2013,Meeks!,0,"So I've played a decent amount of this game since release and the more I play, the more I'm reminded of the last SimCity game.\n\nTons of hype, tons of potential, lots of disappointment and bugs.\n\nI'm seeing very similar issues with education that I'm seeing in Simcity 2013.  People not going to school even though you have tons of educational facilities, all the bonuses to attract people to get educated and so forth and still, a large portion are uneducated or poorly educated.\n\nIssues with garbage collection, yea, that bug is pretty self-explanatory.  It seems garbage collection and corpse collection aren't triggering the right flags.\n\nSome of the special buildings are bugged completely and never activate, such as the oil refinery\n\nImports and exports are heavily glitched or just not coded correctly to work.\n\nSo far those are the most common ones, there are several others that I can't describe right now.\n\nI will say the water mechanics are quite interesting, although, water operates WAY too slowly when building hydro dams.   I literally have to go into the dev menu and change the sim speed to x128 to properly fill the reservoir in a timely manner, otherwise it would take hours to even DAYS of real life to fill.   There are some other water bugs I found as well, such as having too much water will cause mass chaos with water generation and will flood your whole map.  IT WILL NOT STOP UNLESS YOU REDUCE THE DEPTH OF THE RESERVOIR.\n\nHydro dams are glitchy af as well which is really disappointing, they do not work correctly but when they do man they produce a ton of power.  Highest I've gotten I think was 14,000 MW at 85% efficiency.  The only hint I'm giving you guys for them is to make sure you have your dam LOWER than the water generation point at the edge of the map.  If it's at the same height or higher, it won't cause a heavy flow of water which is used to generate power.  So also make sure you're not too far away from the flow because the flow directly behind the dam is what contributes, and as well most importantly, your ability to get rid of the water it releases because your power generation also is highly influenced by that.  It's really difficult (Too difficult tbh).\n\nThere's also a bunch of unreleased content, such as the advanced turbines for the hydro dam.  Water also doesn't flow down stream correctly or down angled hills and becomes hidden by the terrain.  The concept for their water physics is cool and all but really poorly executed in the real world.   If you can master it, you can have a ton of run with it.\n\nTraffic is better in this game but the fact people can't make right hand turns on red lights makes no sense (in NA) and this leads to a massive amount of traffic congestion.  The majority of traffic is people making right hand turns.   Also turn phasing in roundabouts is really dumb, I've watched the traffic in the right hand lane go for ages before anyone could turn left, it was really ineffective.\n\nHighways also need a lot more love, I have a difficult time finding a use for them when large roads seem to give you a LOT more lanes than highways which makes no freaking sense.  They also take a lot less room than highways.  Yes I know highways with how they're coded can be used quite well for traffic flow since there are no traffic lights but tbh, I can do the same with normal roads it seems they weren't thinking.  Large roads should have just been made as highways or highways given the option for far larger lanes.\n\nPremade intersections are cool and all, but it would be really nice to see premade on and off ramps you can use as a template.\n\nThe international airport not having a cargo line makes absolutely no sense when the normal airport has it.  It also doesn't have a built in bus stop, subway and so forth which again makes no sense.  It seems the regular airport is better than the international airport oddly enough.\n\nSpeaking of Simcity 2013, you should have taken something else from their playbook.  Trade depots where you can store cargo for Semi-trucks.   You have cargo ships, cargo trains, cargo planes but literally no depot for trucks, it makes no sense at all.  Unlike Simcity just don't make it have vehicles, just be a place for people to drop cargo.  Yes I know some industry spaces will do this very thing but tbh, it's a waste of industrial zoning and when you grow the storage places disappear.\n\nAlso rail depots and subway depots do NOT provide enough trains.   For the massive amount of space they consume they definitely need to be providing more.   Not only do you have to place the unit, you have to connect all the rails which takes an ungodly amount of space to do correctly, especially if you want to connect both the rear and front side.  Btw, I noticed the other rail connections in the building are essentially useless, why bother having them if they aren't going to be used?   You can just extend the model of the building to have them going in a circle.  If they are used, then the trains SHOULD FREAKING USE THEM.  Don't even get me started on the ridiculous collision issues with the trains where they all magically just disappear and reset.\n\nAlso, why can't I import sewage?  It seems pretty dumb that I can't import garbage and sewage for a profit.\n\nAnyway, I know there are several more issues here I haven't mentioned but man, I wanna like this game and for the most part I do but these glaring issues are REALLY frustrating.   Then there's the terrain editing tool, ugh I'll stop now.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031347072445128722/

Would be nice to be explicit in when a double turn is allowed.  Where is No Turn on Red?

Request for Expanded Fire Incidents in Cities Skylines II,TAIWAN①,0,"Dear Cities Skylines II Team,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share a suggestion that I believe could add a new layer of realism and challenge to the gameplay experience in Cities Skylines II.\n\nCurrently, I have noticed that fire incidents seem to be limited to trees and residential buildings. While this is certainly engaging, I believe the game could benefit from an expansion of fire incidents to include government buildings such as police stations, hospitals, utility departments, and various types of power plants.\n\nIntroducing fire incidents to these essential structures would not only increase the complexity of city management but also provide players with additional strategic challenges. It could prompt players to develop more comprehensive emergency response plans, taking into account the potential impact on critical services and infrastructure.\n\nI understand that game development involves careful consideration and balancing, but I believe this enhancement would contribute to a more immersive and dynamic simulation in Cities Skylines II.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.

I'm not necessarily up for killing him off, but given that the majority of messages are now junk (really doesn't give me much clue as to what I need to be investing my time in) does it make sense for there to be this endless stream of notification? How many times do I need to be notified that Mrs Evans has opened a new business at 43 Everglade, or something equally trite? Perhaps some priority of notifications can work, such that if something important comes up (fire, disaster and the like) that does make an irritating noise - and for the rest, either  keep it quiet, or some innocuous sound every 30 seconds. Whereas now, it's like the game designers made it so that I MUST hear every last notification that the bird produces - which suggests that by the time my city is an actual city I will have stabbed forks into my eyes just for something else to focus on. \n\nAnd on a similar note, will we be getting some radio updates, or the opportunity to create some in the workshop?

Looked forward to DLCs was I,buda atum,8,"Prerelease, I reckoned all the dlc for CS2 would come to at least a grand. And I thought they'd come up with a base game that would make them all worth every penny, to me. I even began looking at upgrading my 64gb 3080 10875H, for though I got 12fps on a million population in CS with a day taking half a minute, I doubted I'd get on it anything close to what I made myself believe could be a billion in CS2 despite the use of all cores. \n\nI figured, after developing the successful CS and seen what modders did with it, CS2 would be a hugely improved game, and I really couldn't wait. So yes, I preordered, and I justified it by professing my desire to support CO considering the almost 8k hours enjoyment I'd gotten from CS. I even thought my 10875H wouldn't play it, and contemplated an upgrade to a desktop.\n\nShill, is it called? I was a super shill defending prerelease, and even wrote here somewhere that PDX should please take my money, and anyone who said otherwise got the wrong side of my tongue. Then the day came when I got the game, and 10 hours in felt, okay, it's early, it's got bugs, it will get better, and went on to put in 150+ hours in week 1.\n\nSince then however, having got to 100k, it's not the FPS that gets to me (didn't get to me in CS neither), nor the bugs (though the post), nor is it the fact cims love their elementary schools they stay there like forever, nor even the reported day taking minutes (my 100k city still runs like it did with 0k with a tick over every second). It's the gameplay itself that gives me downers.\n\nIt's like there's not really much to play in the game, and I doubt I'd book 1000 hours playing it as it is. Like the developers are all new to the genre and don't know what made CS the amazing game it is.\n\nLooking back, I'd have paid for CS Evolved and Remastered if that were what it was, but what seems to have happened is they made a game for console instead of for pc, which is rather sad since (I think) this sort of game (or my gameplay) is not console playable.\n\nThey could fix it I guess, and give me more data about what's going on in the game so I can see how my decisions affect how cities develop for instance, plus smaller services and better roadtools et al, but I worry even that might not do it for me considering all else they've done or not done to the game.\n\nWhat's more sad is I've tanked out playing CS too, and haven't played it in months, though I do see me having at least one more go at it once I get over my CS2 disappointment, and might even delve into procedural objects which seem to make it a different game entirely.\n\nDLCs? I got, or rather, have been promised some with my CS2 prerelease, but damned if I'm ever going to hastily throw money at whatever they release in future until I've seen what those who do rush to purchase it make of it first.\n\nGuess I'm confessing I learnt a lot. I play only two games, CS and AoE2, so the CS2 hype got me despite those longer in the tooth with experience of prerelease warning me extensively. I'm also writing this to apologise for not heeding their warnings, and hope they'd forgive me for shilling for CS2. Just that I couldn't imagine CO wouldn't have learnt from CS and evolved, but what I got was a de-evolution from CS, in my opinion, and I am hugely disappointed.\n\nCity Skylines is a game that could be played in different styles, so I do not expect everyone nor most people to feel the way I do about CS2, which no doubt may suit your play style but just doesn't suit mine. Mods might make me sing a different tune in the end, but for now I wish I could get a refund just to make my point, because this purchase is not what I believed I was promised, and I wouldn't want to support this as it it.\n\nHad to get this off my chest. If the game had met expectations, I wouldn't be here writing all this, and you'd likely not be here reading it neither, because we'd have both been far too busy enjoying the game instead of reading a rant. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case at the moment, sadly, for me at least.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031346899449578130/

I'll buy as soon as there's a Linux version,elthariel,101,"I was extremely disappointed noticing on Steam the game will run on windows only. I was about to pre-order it, being so naive about paradox and their usual Linux support. Lucky me, I double checked to see the minimum GPU requirements and saw Win-only.\n\nI'm not going to dual boot, I'm not going to run the game through Proton, I'm just gonna cry, pray and wait.\n\nI know we might only be a minor market share but we're a vocal one. And not only when complaining. I converted many friends to CS, and even though they run it on Windows, they likely might not have heard about the game without a Linux user. I believe multi-platform support was a factor in the game success.\n\nMoreover, many Linux users have development skills, which is useful for a game that benefits so much from modding. They're more likely to contribute to the community. This in turn increase the value of the game and its sales.\n\nI hope that the new guy who decided to stop multi-platform will [strike]get fired[\/strike] awaken soon and do a more in-depth analysis of the factors behind CS1's success, and bring back multi-platform.\n\nI also hope the devs will communicate soon on the issue so we can either :\n- start again believing in the studio and start our timer for a multi-platform release\n- or gather the material required for some voodoo curses that will avenge our crushed hopes\n\nThanks again for your work on CS1 though, apparently we'll keep playing it for a while",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5824898961046575170/

Nothing great, nothing special but a new home.\nAt first I noticed a traffic jam and didn't think much of it. It was rush hour and my road layout far from perfect and public transport almost non existant so it happend at times.\nBut when the traffic jam still was going on and even got larger by noon I investigated.... only to find a darn Taxi that couldn't get out of it's street parking spot.\nMaybe it was blocked by the car behind, maybe the driver forgot how to drive, maybe it wanted to instantly make a u-turn.. idk.\nBut that single effing Taxi managed to block all traffic in it's lane which in return blocked a junction, that then blocked the other lane and all other streets crossing it which in return blocked the next juntion and so on...\nAbout half my city came to a halt and cims already started ordering pizza to their cars, helping the traffic jam to grow.. while the unaffected ones fled town, making the population drop to 12k.\nAnd what did the game about it? Maybe delete that Taxi? Maybe make other cars drive through it like it usually does when something effs up? Slowly despawn all traffic to that location? Naahhh too easy.\nAll the game did was despawn incoming traffic, turning the cars into pedestrians who walked to the next crossing where already 150 people waited to cross the blocked streets.\nI tried letting the game run for 15 minutes to sort itself out, I deactivated the taxi depot to maybe despawn the car, hell I even reloaded the last autosave and destroyed the road.. but unfortunately in that save the jam already started to build up so it didn't help and the one before that was an hour before.\nSo I gave up.. where's the point in playing a game where a single bugged car can basically destroy your entire city?

Everyone read this and tell me about your opinions,The King,33,"First and foremost, I'd like to thank Paradox and CO for their hard work on this game. I have previously opened a discussion to express my respectful opinions about the game and responded respectfully to community comments.\n\nI'll keep this brief. From the moment I heard about the game's release, I set aside money to buy it, both to support CO and to benefit from its advantages, purchasing the most expensive edition.\n\nI have been playing city building and base building games since my childhood and they are among my favorite game genres.\n\nHere are my final points:\n\nI understand the decisions made by the company and the board, being a marketing manager myself. These decisions are focused on generating more revenue and centralization, and I respect and agree with them.\n\nHowever, in this process, ignoring the basic wishes and concerns of the community and thousands of fans of this game, in my opinion, completely negates the positive aspects of the company's profit-oriented decisions.\n\nUltimately, CS2 is a sequel, and there is a community primarily made up of fan players, not new ones. Your primary goal should have been to make these players happy.\n\nThe ratio of likes to complaints clearly shows that this goal was not achieved. I haven't seen so many complaints in a major game since COD MW3.\n\nWhat I find incomprehensible is your lack of response to these complaints. Although many are related to performance, the most intense complaints are about removing the Steam workshop and your endless monetization efforts.\n\nYour board or marketing department may introduce new revenue streams like DLCs, but this has not been well-received by your loyal players. These reactions are not just in written form; people are talking about not buying any more add-ons or games from Paradox\/CO.\n\nA simple data analysis would confirm that the proportion of these people is likely higher than those who will buy your DLCs.\n\nOn top of all this, promoting a DLC seems very odd, and as far as I have read, no one is happy with it.\n\nMy humble advice is to review your entire roadmap and focus on winning back the loyal players you are about to lose or have lost. Otherwise, the projected profit margin could turn seriously negative, which could be disastrous for your game studio.\n\nPersonally, aside from the graphics and visually appealing additions, I am not satisfied with the game.\n\nCompared to CS1, much longer play times are required to build a large city.\n\nWhen I come home tired from work, I don't want to spend a lot of time developing a city. I want to build the city of my dreams with mods and unlimited resources from the workshop. Simply put, make the sandbox unlimited option available and host mods like endless demand in your own system.\n\nAdditionally, I understand you will use your mod workshop, but why completely eliminate the Steam workshop? Activate both your own workshop and Steam, and if you must eliminate it, do so gradually.\n\nThank you for reading. I understand everyone has their valid reasons, but I believe ignoring the general dissatisfaction will not lead us to a positive outcome.\n\nRegards,\n\nThe King",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031346570758751109/

A Blast From The Past...,zaltocleotl,0,"Way back in March we got this almost prophetic article...\n\nCities Skylines 2 Should Launch With Every Cities Skylines DLC\nCities Skylines 2 Mods | 24 MAR, 2023\n\nCities Skylines 2 Should Launch With Every Cities Skylines DLC\nCities Skylines has been receiving a flurry of expansion packs and smaller DLC releases since 2015, introducing new mechanics, building types, settings, and a handful of radio stations. Every year, the game has been blessed with the launch of different DLC packs, with most years seeing the release of multiple packs, thereby creating one of the most intricate and lifelike city builders around.\n\nWith the upcoming release of Cities Skylines 2, Colossal Order aims to take the series to new heights, and it cannot afford to abandon the content in the first game. The players have dedicated a significant amount of time and money to Cities Skylines, and launching the sequel with less content than its predecessor would provide little incentive for current players to switch. Therefore, the second game must incorporate everything that the first game offers and expand on it with further DLC and free updates.\n\nKerbal Space Program 2 is a prime example of a simulation game that launched with fewer features than its predecessor. Despite being a highly anticipated sequel to the beloved space sim, fans were disappointed to find out that the game lacked much of the content from the first installment. Additionally, the game is riddled with bugs and stability issues, which has caused several players to demand refunds. As a result, many prospective buyers have been deterred, and the existing fanbase has been given little motivation to switch to the latest title.\n\nTo avoid the mistakes of other major simulation games, Cities Skylines 2 must not compromise on content. The game should include all existing features from Cities Skylines, such as the option to play with natural disasters, design eco-friendly cities, construct distinctive industrial zones, oversee schools, and hold concerts. Instead of dividing the first game\u2019s content into DLCs for profit, Cities Skylines 2 should amplify those mechanics and integrate them as core elements. This not only prevents alienating loyal fans but also attracts new players with a comprehensive and compelling gameplay experience.\n\nWhile graphical enhancements are enticing, they alone cannot suffice, and removing Cities Skylines\u2019 DLC content would be a disservice to the players. Colossal Order must guarantee that Cities Skylines 2 delivers a stellar experience right from its release. With the opportunity to establish a new benchmark for simulation sequels, the developers must leave no stone unturned to make it a resounding success.\n\nAuthor: www.modscities2.com",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031346570758744453/

Drama and doom sell views and while i'm sure this game definitely has some optimisation issues to sort out you all need to take everything with a grain of salt. Are you all really not going to play this game? no. So take your posting for likes to twitter where it belongs. We all had high hopes for this game... I hope this doom and drama only affect this forum and doesn't impact the engagement from modders and developers.

I was thinking overheating, but hella surprised if it was. This third time my pc restarted after my game froze. Now before the freezing I opened task manager and temp core to observe my temps. What I was seeing from my GPU was 100% usage in the main menu. My GPU went from 50C to 72C in just 3 minutes. What changed that made it eat more resources than before? When I was in my city GPU dropped to 70% on average with 68C. CPU in the menu was around 30-40% while in game was around 70-80%.

I have bought the 1st game and most of the DLC's for it, but I did it in separate occasions and at reasonable price, but I digress...)\n\nThere is only 2 options, the basic game and the ultimate edition, so I tried to click on the ultimate edition option in the store page to see if it shows more info like \""you already have the base game, go here or there for just the upgrade\"", unfortunately there is nothing, the option for purchasing it for myself is greyed out and there is only the option to buy it for someone else.\n\nWould this mean I will never be able to upgrade and obtain the extra packs which comes with it? is there or will be any other way to obtain this upgrade?\n\nThank you very much in advance everyone.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540051992992271547/

"Ya know, we are pounding this game...",zaltocleotl,1,"justifiably, in my opinion, and those of many.\nBut hey, there's some good things about it too. They're overshadowed so heavily by so much, but they're there.\nI was and am a huge Cities: Skylines fanboy. I even made a couple assets and a couple maps and published a few game saves. The only such things I've ever done in a game on Steam for twenty years. 20 f'ing years.\n\nSo here's some of the things I like about this game...\n\n1. More roads. nicer roads, roundabouts\/culdesacs, highways, parking. New additions, and some don't work well, but they're there, and I'm sure they'll improve.\n2. Road Tools: At least they're there. Why they're so borked... IDK. But the street\/sidewalk\/lights is great. So is the maintenance bldg.\n3. Parallel Road Tool! Freaking about time! The C:S mods worked, most of the time, but so far I haven't had a single problem laying them, and they lay great. Pretty! Nice job on that.\n4. Zoning over other zones with one click, and the click-and-hold are both awesome!\n5. New zoning types in residential. Mixed and rows are great additions. \n6. New Spec Ind is cool. Stupid limit on size\/shape but still cool. \n7. Areas button is great, for both uses.\n8. Signature Blds also a good idea, and nice assets for vanilla.\n9. Good choices of power, though realism was given second or third seat.\n10. Water system is good, but underground view makes it a pain. Like the buildings and functions.\n11. Health and Death didn't get much done to it, but new assets, of course. One each, but that's a vanilla game. Don't spend a lot of time on multiple assets, let the moders do that.\n12. Not much to complement on the garbage tab, but at least there's more options to start with, and the drawable dump is great.\n13. The schools are also hard to compliment, but they get the job done, I hope. They don't look bad, just not attractive. But they're schools, not museums. Complaints about 'only one type and it gets repetitive' are vapid. Vanilla game. One asset per function unless needed, let the modding community make redundant assets\/functions.\n14. Fire tower and heli are nice new toys. Make sense, especially for us who like our rural maps.\n15. The prison and CIB are neat! And work. Nice additions. Going to be some interesting mods based on those.\n16. Transit is just... we could go on and on. Pro and Con. But I'm doing pros. The taxis are great. So far seem to help, too. Like them. The way you can move a stop bench or sign and the route moves along with it is MORE THAN WELCOME. So much better! Great job! Glad to see some additions in route views and the likes. Also like the Bus lanes, just wish they were more exclusive\/restricted. \n17. Great to see all six transportations in the base game, and so much functionality and tools. \n18. So many parks! For vanilla! Everyone keeps comparing this to C:S when they shouldn't. There are times to, yes, but not in quantity of content. No way. The parks have flaws, but they better get fixed. But we have more sizes and more in each size, and there are some nice looking ones. I miss the Park Areas, though.\n19. Landscaping is so much smoother. Flaws, yes, but it works so much better than C:S did on release. I was crashing, along with many others, just trying to smooth a bit. I think I was actually shaking a bit when I tried it the first time in this game. LOL\n20. Going back to the roads. The aesthetic. The way they meet up. Making junctions. The almost fluid way the junctions meld and flow as you move your landing spot is awesome. You can achieve some amazing junctions. Especially on highways. Maybe my favorite bit of this game is how good and even realistic you can make junctions, or curved roads, or parallel roads. And they look so great! \nWhen MoveIt and LineProp and Anarchy hits, cities are going to look \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 AMAZING.\nIf your machine can handle it. Just pause it, work, unpause it. \nOkay, that's twenty from me.\nWhat's good, cool, neat, awesome, or fantastic to you?",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/4031346570748992481/
"WotW #4, Latest Patch, and Mail Issues Update",GnuHorn,14,"I've spent a lot of time over the past couple of weeks, especially the last week, being critical of CO's communication and I think it's important to have the integrity to note that this week's word of the week better reflected what I want to see from them:\n\n - Direct communication on the focus and that bug fixes will not fall behind.\n - Discussion on the issues plaguing the cadence of bug fixes, rather than statements that all the small ones have been solved.\n - Open acknowledgement of where actions might impact the community and to set priorities with a firm plan.\n\nThey did a better job with that this week, and I think it's important to acknowledge that. I'd like to see this kind of thing continue.\n\nI was originally going to just post about my structured testing of the latest patch and some differences I've seen in Post Office performance that weren't in the patch notes. Reading the WotW, I see that they've acknowledged the behavioral issues with the mail system that I and others documented last week here. That's really good.\n\nThose issues do remain in this patch, and while I can't be certain the the mail behavior changes from this patch were intended or not (as undocumented changes do happen and in games like this, tweaks to one system may impact another), but it's worth communicating the different behavior.\n\nThis weekend, during testing, I found that instead of two semi-trucks each delivering 25k mail to the Post Office, I instead deleted my Post Offices and then I got 1 truck with a seemingly more random number, which closer reflects the behavior I'd like to see.\n\nSince the 50k mail delivery behavior was constant before the patch, I believe the behavior difference is due to the patch but it may be other factors I can't see.\n\nI also noted that while mail vans were still often not delivering most of their mail, the ratios seemed to on average be much better, with more mail trucks appearing to return with 1.6-1.9tns of mail rather than 2-2.1 tns. \n\nMaybe this was just random, but I played the game on max for an extended period of time and instead of endlessly accumulating mail, now my little Post Office in my little test city was keeping up with it.\n\nI also found that while the mail routes still don't scale with the mail backlog, if you scale out your city and add zoning and population, the higher number of routes this brings will help scale the under-delivery of mail a little bit better, even with the introduction of a Cargo Dock. \n\nI am still seeing in my indicators that the capacity is still in the dark orange zone for mail, so while the balance is better, it's still not net keeping up according to that, but the situation appears much more manageable now even though more fixes will be needed (although it seems that CO has seen the reports and agreed with the issues that were cited, which is good... we can settle the debates on whether these are intended behavior or not, they are not).\n\nI'd like to know if others are seeing similar things.\n\nAlso, one common complaint I see in posts about this is that adding mail buildings does not solve the problem, and the reason why was this constant stockpiling of new mail that is still maybe a problem. Because the number of routes doesn't scale by adding buildings, but the amount of mail increases, the solution is likely to delete Post Office buildings that are at low numbers of constant active routes, as scaling up will make the problem worse due to the nature of the unintended behavior.\n\nIn any case, it's good to see better communication, and that makes me feel slightly better about the issues we're facing.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540052310305973028/

Some thoughts on the delayed DLCs / modding support,mattkrupo,3,"Hi there,\n\nSo after reading CO's Word of the Week, I'm going to share some thoughts I have following today's confirmation that the expansion pass DLCs are being delayed. I'll admit I had been anticipating this game for many months and went ahead and purchased the Ultimate Edition to take advantage of the additional content that would come with it. When purchasing the game, I also assumed (wrongly!) that modding support would be available off the bat, or at least, shortly after release. I was a bit naive, so my mistake.  \n\nI guess before I go off listing some of the things I'm not happy about, I'll say that I do really like CS2 and I wouldn't take the time here to complain if I didn't think the game has great potential, and is worth fixing. However, to me, the delay of the DLCs and Paradox Mods is a big disappointment -- and to me, even more so than the performance\/simulations troubles to date (which I won't get into in this post since they have been discussed so much on this forum already). I'll just say, I would have been fine with running the game on medium\/lower settings while the CO team works on those performance\/simulation fixes -- but right now, the game just feels so incomplete from a content perspective, and without additional mods\/DLCs for the foreseeable future, I'm starting to feel like I will probably uninstall this game for now, and come back once there's more content to work with. \n\nI understand that it wouldn't be reasonable to expect all of the CS1 DLC content to be included in the CS2 base game, but I feel like there are certain CS1 DLCs that were game-changers and really should have been part of the core CS2 experience. Also, there are some common-sense things that I think should have been included. \n\nHere we go:\n\n* PARK\/GREEN SPACE TOOLS: I thought the Parklife DLC was one of the best DLCs from CS1 and allowed us to customise our park spaces. This, to me, is a core feature that should have been in CS2's base game. Instead, we are left with a few ploppable city parks (which are fine!) but as your city grows you end up reusing them over and over. Doesn't look great.\n \n* CUSTOMIZABLE AIRPORTS: This was also one of the best DLCs of CS1. I really enjoyed the ability to create\/customise your own airports. This was one feature I was really hoping would be in the base game as well. \n\n* MORE VARIETY FOR TRAIN STATIONS\/SCHOOLS\/HOSPITALS ETC: I'm not a fan of having only one type of train station, one hospital, one high school... etc etc. For example, this game could really use a smaller, regional sized train station. It looks silly having the same looking train station all over the city (same goes for schools, hospitals, etc). It would be nice to have more variety in these core assets. I love that the map is 5X bigger than CS1... but maybe add some more variety of assets to go with the bigger map? I saw that there's a Regions pack on the way (which looks great), so hopefully some of the assets from that will include new types of essential buildings. \n\n* PRO SPORTS STADIUM\/ENTERTAINMENT VENUE: How is there no professional sports stadium or major entertainment complex in the base game, haha? You give us a big medieval castle, but no stadium? Now, there is a football and soccer field provided in the current game but they are tiny -- something better suited at the local high school than a major entertainment complex in the downtown core. Honestly, can you name a major city in the world that doesn't some type of sizeable stadium, or entertainment venue? My downtown looks silly without it. Again, to me, this should have been in the base game. \n\n* SAN FRANCISCO SET: This was a letdown. From what I can tell, we only got a map of San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge and a few muscle cars? There are so many great San Fran buildings that could have been included in this (Transamerica building, Coit Tower, San Fran city hall, Salesforce Tower, to name a few). Even just a few of them would have been nice. \n\n* BRIDGES\/PORTS DLC 2024: One thing that the CS2 base game has a lot of is bridges. There are several different types of bridges, and a sea port option, in the base game... which makes me wonder why 'Bridges\/Ports' this would be one of the first DLCs in the pipeline? I'm guessing there will be some new gameplay options, beyond a bunch of new assets. But still, I'd much rather take more parks, airports, etc., as mentioned above, over some more bridge and port options. \n\n* REALISTIC POPULATION\/JOB NUMBERS: I was hoping they would improve this from the original game, but these numbers still seem ridiculously low. My 48 floor office building (Lizard Inc.) only has 115 employees? That's less than 3 employees per floor... I also just find it weird that my town of 20,000 people had multiple skyscrapers of 40+ floors, and a busy highway system... it really looks like a city of 300-500K, not 20K. It would be nice if these numbers were more realistic. \n\n* OUTSIDE CONNECTIONS: It would be cool to know more about our outside connections, and perhaps incorporate that into the overall city-building strategy. That could be a future DLC, I suppose. One of the old SimCity games let you see your adjacent cities on a map, and you could see how big they were. It would be interesting to expand on that. \nFor example, I have a passenger train running regularly to the city of Carrick (which I know nothing about). I actually don't even know if it's a city.. .maybe it's a town.. or a village? Anyway, it would be cool to be able to see some information about it, and use that info to make strategic decisions. For instance, if it's a major city, maybe I would want to prioritise building connections to it rather than another outside connection that is only a town or village. I'm sure resources and other economic considerations could be tied in as well. \n\nAnyway, I know that someday many of the comments mentioned above will be addressed with through DLCs or mods. But these are just a few things that I wished were in the game right now, to make the current experience that much more realistic and enjoyable. I don't regret buying the game... but it really should have been in better shape at launch. So here's to hoping Colossal Order gets these performance issues sorted out soon, so it can get back to creating more content to help round out this game. \n\nCheers folks.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540052310305753511/

What you have now is this uncontrollable automatic mess.\n\nWhy the hell would I want this traffic mostly going right into a small town and one lane going left to the motorway?

Pull out your old source code and take a look....\nI want bus and tram tracks placed in the lane I wish! And I want left\/right\/forward traffic to be directed where I, the human being, thinks is best.

It clutters up the view that's most important: the freaking tunnel\/subway build!\n\nJust show the underground view, sorta like a 3d ant tunnel view with things that are protruding from the surface that would be  destroyed were you to place a tunnel there. have it in plain sight so it's easier for us to plan around them. sometimes, when you try to connect two stations, the game destroys building on top because it's too close to the surface and you have to finagle around with it by guessing a bunch of different angles, depths, etc. it's not clear where the terrain is too close or if there is an object in the way. it's also not clear what depths each line is. having something like a color gradient which indicates its depth colored on the tunnels would help.\n\nOn subway entrances: it's a little odd  that placing subway entrances aren't more free form. why do we have to snap them to a road? its not like cars have to pull up to them. Many times, subway entrances are in the center of a block, not anywhere near the road. at minimum it should only require a pedestrian walkway connection plus electric connection via underground wire, which already exists in the game. I wish they would get rid of this limitation so we can build more true-to-life subway lines. \n\nlastly, it's super annoying that whenever you want to make a new service line, all the service lines, whether they're bus or train lines are visible. In my transit-rich city this gets very confusing and cluttered! Please enable the toggle to see certain lines when creating new routes. when trying to plan out routes! i've tried toggling them off in the map info view but they still show up when you go into the route creation tool! what gives???",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540052310302101616/

Geothermal won't provide electricity for me but only for export,Witch Moon/Canondah,13,"I set up a small village away from my main city and there wanted to use a geothermal power plant since a water source was conveniently available.

Even if I add a transformer station and connect it to either high voltage connection, absolutely nothing will be directed to that transformer station. I tried cutting the export line to my neighbour, but nothing changes other than the export drops to zero, none of the other lines gain any voltage. Anyone else having similar problems?

And what tips or tricks have you discovered to get around them?\n\nHere are some of mine:\n\nTraffic Jams at roundabouts - Using the roundabout creator, i have found a lot of issues with traffic jams caused by cims crossing (even though i removed the crossings). One trick i have been using is creating a flyover bypass using a single lane highway for going straight ahead. This seems to lessen the traffic at these spots creating a little better flow.\n\nPath Bridge Crossings - I have also tried using pathways to encourage Cims to use when crossing the road. It doesn't really work due to how long the ramps have to be, But i have discovered that if you build the path over the road at 7.5m, then create the ramp down to 2.5m the path will form a sharp drop to the pavement\/sidewalk at the side of the road, making the ramp need to be a little shorter.\n\nRoundabouts - I have also started going back to the old C:S method of manually building roundabouts using highways and other one way roads. This doesn;t seem to work very well for small roundabouts, but does seem to function better than the game made ones if made large enough. And they are upgradable\/replaceable with different road types.\n\nSo there's a few tricks i have been trying to get around the crappy AI, what tips and tricks to get around buggy traffic have you found?\n\nI'm still trying to work out a way to get around the terrible lane changing that causes all kinds of random pain.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540052310301348746/

Road tools are extremely frustrating.,xXZoraLinkXx,3,"I've been an avid player of CS1 with plenty (\""plenty\"" meaning needing-to-buy-more-RAM-to-play kinda plenty) of mods running, including Road Anarchy and Move It. Using just these two mods alone made road building SO MUCH easier because you could just create the most complicated layouts and interchanges imaginable with relative ease. Granted, it still took several hours for me to create one perfect interchange with decoration and whatnot, but it was worth it and mostly frustration-free.\n\nNow, the new road tools certainly have a few nice new features with them. But it is still so incredibly frustrating to build a seemingly flat, straight road with a gradual incline and then see it do the bendy snake 3000. I mean, come on. Terrain is modified randomly and without apparent reason. Building quay roads is a pain in the butt. Try to build a straight quay road on slightly hilly terrain, I dare you. One wrong step and it's creating a rollercoaster. On a three-lane highway. This is so incredibly frustrating.\n\nI don't mind bugs. I don't mind early releases. I don't mind weird glitches. But if something gets so much praise from all over the place and still turns out THAT flawed, I feel genuinely angry.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nBuilding a road should create the road pictured, not the wobbly rollercoaster snake it too often does.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540051992993708726/

I do get random blur effect with a stutter sometimes when panning and levelling up. \n\nSome issues I have: (Performance not being a point.)\n- Crappy terrain mesh (tunnels). Being able to see between two terrains.\n- Shadows for trees appearing in tunnels.\n- Mostly winter simulation only effecting the tops of cars\/buildings and terrain not utilised by the city. Lawns of houses and roads remain nice and green all year around.\n- Seasons not changing or staying too long compared to others.\n- Chirp comments being mostly negative and not applicable (when there are abundance of hospitals\/electricity\/police stations in their area servicing). \n- Development ignoring water and building on top of it.\n- Citizens complaining that they can't afford rent, when its already low for their demographic.\n- Education being the specification for taxation, instead of income.\n- Seemingly endless demand for low density residential.\n- No CRTL+Z, Delete\/Backspace button to enable bulldozing. (Hasn't work for me, if it is there. It really seems it should be.)\n\nCities Skylines, I love you - but common. We all expected better out of you. You've joined the flock in regards to developers who give their audience a half done game with no regards to performance.\nThis isn't something we (your fans) should be shamed for, as if we're the dumb ones for pre-purchasing a game or buying on release date. As if we should know better than to expect a game that's almost perfect or at the very least runs properly for the majority of people.\n\nAll that being said, I am enjoying this - for lack of better words, mediocre game.

Possible workaround for players facing multiple crashes,[RzL] Caius1er,0,"Hello guys.\n\nI spent (too much) time analyzing the behavior of the crashes I encountered during the last weeks on CS2, and I wanted to share few tweaks which did the tricks for me (keep in mind that crashes still can happen, but in my case they have been drastically reduced\/have stopped and I suffer less from stuttering)\n\n1_ kill UnityCrashHandler64.exe process in your task manager when you launch the game, \nwhen on the paradox launcher or before loading your save (for some reason setting it  \""Launch as administrator\""  block it to launch as a process). It should be listed with Cities Skylines process in taskmanager.\n\n2_ Limit the refreshrate to 60 in the Paradox launcher. A lot of people thinks that crashes are due to game simulation desyncing with what your GPU renders.\n\n3_ deactivate upscaling in graphic options (advanced tab)\n\n4_ before loading your save and when you are in the ingame menu, set the game priority to \""Real Time\"" in task manager, under the Details tab.\n\n5_ set numbers of autosave to Unlimited (erase useless autosaves when you stop playing)\nI run the game with a 12700k, 16go ddr4 Xmp on and a rtx3080 and I can finally play smoothly and without interruption.

Something so simple... geeze.\nYou gave us roundabouts. And then you didn't make it possible to link pedestrian sidewalks to it. How? How in the holy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 did you screw that up? How!?\nYou loaded the graphics up to the point that even your \""Suggested Hardware\"" is incapable of playing the game beyond a small town AND without turning off all your fancy eye candy that you stuffed into the game to the point of puking.\nThe pedestrians walk like they're in acute rectal pain with each and every step. They walk right into traffic and block it. They walk across streets as if vehicles are intangible and can't run them flat. SO realistic!\nDon't even get me started on the 'deepest simulation' ever. Who do you think you are kidding with that? Simple math and a glance at the info panels blows that proposition right out of consideration as anything other than marketing lies.\nTraffic that looks like everyone is on LSD.\nPale overlays in transit route UI makes it so hard to see the route lines and you end up just wishing you could play a better game, like checkers.\nTrees so poly-stuffed they slow down even the Recommended machine.\nHow long did you work on the aurora? Why? How long do you think someone is going to stare at that? Thirty seconds? A minute?\nMeanwhile, the police stations all have bales of crushed cardboard boxes as hedges. It looks pathetic. A child could create more realistic bushes. There are more realistic hedgerows in Cities 1.\nCitizens 'shop' by joining a crowd somewhere vaguely grocery-adjacent, but don't bother to enter the building asset at all. Or go inside the school, but instead lounge around outside doing nothing but using up graphics and CPU resources with their ridiculously massive teeth that are invisible but still rendered inside the heads of every simulated citizien. Oh, wow, what a great choice! Brilliant! Suck up those resources!\nOh, what have you done?\nParadox, you've proven the growing meme true: Paradox is paradoxically bad.\nColossal Order... that blue and white logo used to mean fun ahead. Now it means... what? The game is going to be overly produced eye candy?\nWhat happened? Was Cities: Skylines a complete fluke? Did you blow your entire wad on it? Nothing left? Because if anything at all was left, it was left on the table and not put into this nightmare travesty.\nThe few new things are either broken or so minor they don't matter. Eye candy for the most part. Like the crosswalks. How can you justify that? Or the stop signs. What is the point of only four-way or nothing? How do we regulate traffic from residential streets onto feeder and artery roads without having the side streets stop? Do you drive? At all? Ever? This is unacceptable. Period.\nWhere is Right Turn On Red at stoplights? You don't drive at all, ever, do you? Any of you. Or you never think at all about driving while you drive.\nI don't have time to list everything so glaringly stupid it's stunning. The list of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and errors in this game is pathetic.\nThe bugs are even more rampant and numerous, and your treatment of bug reports as \""As designed\"" is so pathetic it borders on trolling.\nI'm ready for my ban now, Mister DeMille...",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540051992992008657/

"HUNDREDS hrs into this game, here's My lists of issues I encounter that I believe need attention.",cybohmoob,6,"My list of issues that bothers me a ton.\n\n1.TAXI's are over populating as city grows.\n\n2.Cars are magically vanishing.\n\n3.Lotsa uturning.\n\n4.People crowding the streets if you put TRAM,TRAIN or ect stops near corners. Maybe even middle.\n\n5.Water control tool. You need to add a water control tool that cleans up water that floods.\n\n6.Waterfall. In CS 1 you can make waterfalls.\n\n7.Parking Lots issues. They are causing traffic jams. Right now we have to use alleyways to resolve this.\n\n8.Bus JAMMING itself. When your city gets big and you use more than 8 BUS routes there's huge bus jams at the bus stations and busses go through people running them over as well.\n\n9.Water River creation tool with flow control. Right now there is no possible way at all to create a river. I need to see a tool added to allow a water SOURCE location and it needs to flow using laws of physics. Long short, there needs a river tool.\n\n10.Weather Toggle. There is only 1 map that doesn't have snow. Add a toggle so we can build in NON WHITE SNOW environment and then when we are done, we can toggle weather back to normal. That way the creative mode is easier on the eyes. It's fun for the GAME mode but for unlimited creation mode, we don't care about the weather.\n\n11.Ship route is blocking POWER LINES. This is one annoying issue. I bump into this various times during a city build.\n\n12.Traffic Intelligence. The drivers need to be more intelligent and know how to take another road that leads to the same EXIT or TOWN road out. This is an issue because I hit 100k citizens and I am fighting traffic like crazy. It's mostly because the sims wanna use EXACTLY the same road \""left or right\"" that leads to the next town instead of another road that leads to the town. You can throw a 8 LANE on to the next town and they will all choose the 2 lane out exit. In real life we usually take another road instead of tanking the JAM.\n\n13. Pollution Cleanup tool. When I'm converting a spot to residential after deciding to move Industrial elsewhere I am stuck with all RED. Please add a tool so we can clean it up and KEEP building our city.\n\n14. HIGH SCHOOL football field.  You need to shrink it, have another highschool that doesn't have such a LARGE field. In short, there needs to be more MODELS or all schools. It's unrealistic to have 8 IDENTICAL schools. This sorta ruins the feeling of the sim.\n\n15. Fishing pier. What happened to the fishing docks, piers ? I noticed it's missing and I'm dying to add fishing piers and docks to my city lakes and ponds. Please ADD this. In real life there are fishing docks, piers and more relating to water.\n\n16. Oceanic parks. There needs boardwalks, beach lay downs, boating docks, and FISHING companies. Please add. My oceanic area is as DULL as a wall right now.\n\n17. Disable citizen. Can you allow a toggle to disable Citizens? I don't like the LAG that comes with lots of them walking around while I create the city. I want a toggle to hide them until I am set. I also wanna toggle between them to see if towns ok but I want to enjoy the higher FPS without them during build.\n\n18. Model variety's. Please add more variety to the SKYSCRAPERS, HOMES and CARS. Long short, there needs more models to everything. Seeing a town full of yellow mustangs is ridiculous. There needs other colors too. In real life we see all kinds of colors. There needs many more types of buildings so the homes are all not the same. I see rows upon rows of identical buildings. It's ridiculous. The AI needs to be fixed so when you do masss building it knows to randomize buildings up and not laydown all the same buildings.\n\n\nThat's about it for now. I love this game and that's why I'm sharing this.\n\nI am hundreds of hours into this game and so far I am not that happy about these things.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540051992990516186/

"Thanks for the chats all, but I'm moving on. :)",Dale Kent,124,"EDIT: (Nov 17) I've heard from Paradox support to the query I logged. They confirm I was banned for this post, where I said \""Publishing games as bare bones as possible (even removing content to plunder later, looking at you pre-release DLC that CS2 has), is customer abuse IMO.\"".\n\nThe Paradox support person went on to state: \""Frankly I would have issued a much sterner infraction than the minor \""trollish comments\"" one you got for that!\"" (I can provide a screenshot of the email to those interested).\n\nMy comment got me a one month ban. Proves my point.\n------------------------------------------------------\nORIGINAL POST STARTS HERE:\nI love city building games. I mean the ones where you can build up massive modern metropolis's like in this game. I remember getting my hands on SimCity back in the old days, and instantly fell in love with it. I would lay down roads, zones, services for the city, and watch it grow at my hands. And I loved every single city builder that came along. The various SimCity versions (except 2013), Cities XL\/XXL\/all the versions, City Skylines, and Highrise City. SimCity 4 is definitely my most favourite of the city builders.\n\nWhen I heard that Cities Skylines 2 was being made, I got pretty excited. But also, pretty worried. I was really excited, because a new game in my second favourite type of game was coming out. And the videos made it look really good! But I was worried. Worried because Paradox was publishing it.\n\nWhen CS1 came out, it was an insta-buy for me. I really enjoyed the game. I was happily playing along, making cities, and then the DLC start coming out. Before CS1 came out, for years I had bought Paradox games and the DLC. However, I was really getting annoyed by the DLC policy of Paradox. CS1 came out on the heels of the 80th or something DLC for Crusader Kings 2. Not to mention the countless DLC for HOI and EU that I also played. So when the DLC starting coming out thick for CS1, I decided it was time to bow out of Paradox and put them on \""the list\"". \""The list\"" contains the publishers I will not buy games from. There's a few now, including EA for what they did to SimCity\/Maxis. Paradox had joined them. I did not buy a single item from Paradox after June 2017. I wanted to, believe me. But this was my very minor protest against their DLC policy.\n\nAnd then came Cities Skylines 2. I actually held my ground, until the day before release. I knew if I bought in, I'd be buying into the DLC flood. I was really conflicted. I knew Paradox was going to DLC the hell out of the game, and there was the performance announcement before hand but I knew from experience (with my work) that performance can (and usually does) get fixed. But I REALLY wanted to play a city builder. So I caved, and bought the standard edition. Hey, at least I would minimise my losses to $70 (AUD).\n\nThe day came, and I downloaded it, and started to play. After changing a few graphics settings, I was okay with sitting on medium graphics and tuning a few things like RPS suggested to. And I played.\n\nBut it wasn't too long before I started noticing things. But I kept playing. I noticed even more things, and read about similar things others were noticing on the Paradox forum and here. I got to 25 hours and wrote my review. I didn't want to give a cheap 2 hours review, so I gave the game an honest shot. I was actually really shocked how popular my review became. I just wrote what I honestly saw in the game.\n\nThen the hostility began. I found myself banned for 3 days at Paradox forums for the most flimsy of reasons (the review was being discussed there and I commented on that thread). At around the same time, I started getting threats and hostile posts on my steam profile, my workshop items for other games, and ended up playing whack-a-mole deletion of posts. No point reporting as they were level 0 empty profiles just made to attack me. But I did keep playing, because maybe they had a point. Maybe I'd misunderstood some things.\n\nAnyways, eventually I hit 85 hours. I was done. I did an update to my review, and my 3 points that I feel kill the game for me stand. They are:\n1. Performance and bugs. Whilst performance had improved on the graphics side, over 250k pop my PC would start suffering from repeated stuttering. This was simulation, not graphical. The list of bugs is massive. Just look at the confirmed list on Paradox forums.\n2. Lack of content. The extreme lack of content is really disappointing. Obvious hat tip to DLCing us to hell. Yeah, there's a content creator pack of some couple thousand assets coming for free, but I would put a hundy on it that the original point of that pack was to introduce paid-for curated special content on Paradox mods. But they are \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 their pants and giving it for free now.\n3. Design choices. There are lots of design choices that just simply don't make sense.\n\nIt was at this time that I posted a new thread on Paradox forums outlining the above, and that I was putting the game down for now. Shortly after that thread was posted, I found myself banned for a full month. I have read carefully the code of conduct, the infraction matrix, and also the support page on forum user rules. I cannot see anything I could have legitimately been banned for. I can only think it was because I have been vocal in honest criticism (it's not the only time Paradox has been caught censoring their forums of negative feedback). Their code of conduct and support page also give you some instructions when banned. Contact the moderator in the instance, or if you cannot contact that moderator, email admin@paradoxinteractive. The irony is, when you are banned, you cannot access the messaging system to read the notice why you got banned. Nor can you reply to it. So I've tried emailing (politely) the email address a couple of times. I've had no reply. I don't believe I will get a response either.\n\nSo at this point, I am done. I feel that my feedback is not wanted, nor do they want to hear it. I believe that Paradox doesn't want me around, and I will just continuously be banned at Paradox forums, and if I continue to post here, banned here as well. I actually don't think this post will last long, but hey, let's give it a try. I'll screenshot it and post it to my steam profile. Avanya can't get to me there. Hahaha.\n\nI will never, ever, buy another Paradox product. My experience with Paradox in the past, and especially recently, is that they are a hostile, abusive company that will stop at nothing to suppress honest critical feedback that they believe may impact their shareholder profits. My belief that Paradox is an extremely toxic company has been reinforced with my recent interactions with this company. I will never engage with Paradox forums again. I will never engage with any of their product, or the products of any company that has an association with Paradox. I am completely done with this company.\n\nTo everyone I've chatted with here, go in peace and have some fun. Thank you, all of you, for the fun times I had here. Even you Stealthy, even though I still think you're a Paradox employee here to muffle out any negative comments. You never did answer my question, but it's okay, you're off the hook now. \u02d0steammocking\u02d0\n\nMy review: https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/profiles\/76561197998739866\/recommended\/949230\nParadox thread I got one month ban for: https:\/\/forum.paradoxplaza.com\/forum\/threads\/its-time-to-put-cs2-down.1608679\/",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/3971673333118478195/
anyone unimpressed by the updates thus far?,Haristess,29,"I believe we have had like 2-3 updates since release, but all of them have been tiny little updates, regarding performance.\n\nIm beginning to get a little concerned, because i feel like, we need some gigantic updates, over hauling things like terrain especially water, and water physics.\nThe economy simply doesnt exist, and that too needs a complete rework, and why on earth hasnt rail export been fixed yet?!\nTheres no end of graphical defects within the game, particularly buildings turning black at random, and roundabouts just braking the game, at times.\n\nIm not expecting an editor, nor do i want one right now, but i would like to see the map\/terrain and water to have abit of love and care, so we can begin to make functional rivers and maybe even a waterfall on some of the maps we have. would also be nice if we could choose where we begin within the map, rather than 1 set plot.

potential performance increase by deleting rail connections,Agent_Orange,1,"I've noticed a massive increase in performance when deleting mostly railway connections to the outside world, but any unnecessary connection should be deleted as well. \ntrain stations in general have massive performance issues from what I can tell. \nIf you want a pedestrian access from the outside world, you should use ships. the performance of ships is normal. \n\nthe issue is that potential citizens will spawn in at these outside connections and are rendered. even if your city is tiny, you will have thousands of rendered civilians just standing around invisible at the connection \""looking\"" for a house. \nI have no data on it but I think the issue gets worse as your city gets bigger and more attractive.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540051992990486442/
AI behavior seems to be worse after update.,mikelleh63,2,"My highways are now a joke. Any time there is an entrance or exit, there is a huge backup. I watch the lanes, 3 lanes come in, the left 2 continue on and the right is an exit. Traffic is flowing. Eventually, someone in right lane decides to merge out of exit lane. The car in middle lane stops. Now 5 or 6 cars cut off the stopped car, before he starts again. The AI says 'middle lane is slow' Now every other car is dropping down to the exit lane so they can avoid 'slow' middle lane making it even worse. This happens way too fast. Once it all gets topped, then the real strange things start. Middle lane is now a viual lot, people are now using the left most lane to get by 'slow' middle lane and then cut across 2 lanes (at a 90* angel) to take the exit.

The attitude from CO.\nSo far they haven't admitted a single time that they have release this unfinished cluster\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and just playing word game with us dodging out doubts about the lacking simulation.\n\nI made this reply on the official forum after being very triggered by the post made by their CEO stating they are \""working on the gameplay\"" weeks after releasing the game. And guess what? It, and my account immediately got banned for no reason. I took a screenshot before posting it, and I will just share it here:\n\n----------------\nco_martsu: \nGameplay issues are being actively worked on and we've been also looking into some pathfinding errors. Some bugs take longer to fix than others and it would cause added stress to try and keep a specific cadence so at no point have we committed to one. Since we've had weekly patches thus far I found it best to warn that it's not to be expected in the future, with the sole purpose of trying to manage expectations. While the patch cadence is expected to be longer going forward it doesn't mean we have stopped working on bugfixes.\n----------------\n\nWow, I am very surprised to see that you are working on the gameplays, after releasing the game, as a completed product! What a standard practice!\n\nYou released a game that can not lose, and have no impact\/consequence for whatever action player have taken, and literally have zero gameplay elements besides painting zones and see building pops out. And NOW YOU ARE LOOKING IN TO GAMEPLAY??\nIf you had no clues of what the gameplay should be maybe DO NOT advertise (lie) your half way finished mess as \""Deep Simulation\"", \""Epic scale endless possibilities\"", \""A dynamic world\""? This is false advertising at its max.\n\nHow about, instead of playing with word just admit and be honest with your cohort with the fact that you've release an unfinished game? You keep saying you are working on 'fixing' some 'issues' while it's pretty clear to both side these are not issue, but rather, missing features?\n\n----------------\nco_martsu:\nWe're investigating the bug reports and fixing issues. There's a lot of people enjoying the game so we are not looking to pull it of the market.\nActions speak louder than words: patches will be released and the game improved. I'II share the latest news next week and I hope to see you all then!\n----------------\n\nSo far the players community have paid you money, and spent their own time to QA and test your game. What are we getting in return?\n\nSo how about the some actions from your side:\n - Let's start with you be honest with us, you know more about how incompletely it is more than anyone.\n - How about offering a refund option? So those who are 'enjoying' can keep playing?\n - Give those of us who still have a bit faith in you a detailed roadmap, or maybe a public issue tracker?\n - Maybe consider stop saying \""fixing issues\"" where it's clearly some gameplay elements\/features that you haven't considered before releasing your version\n1.0.0 game?\n\n----------------\nco martsu:\nI would kindly ask for a civil and polite conversation going forward both here and elsewhere on the forum as we actually have our devs read through the feedback and their happiness is important to me. We can take constructive criticism and we take it seriously,\n----------------\n\nGuess what's more disappointing than the unfinished game?\n- Your attitude and the fact that you and your community engagement team are treating us as babies.\nSo far you haven't been taking us seriously, you lie to us about your product, then you kept playing word game with us to hide your lies.

Negativity Causes Delays and Doesn't Help,mackster,52,"TL:DR - Leave out personal attacks, list your issues and ask for help or see how big an issue you actually have and if others have this too. Criticism\/failures have a better chance of resolve if the issues affect many, but the attacking rhetoric that plagues the world we currently live slows down this response as, sometimes, flames mask the real issues.\n\nOK, this isn't a post about stop complaining\/criticising. Its about the method which it is currently being deployed. Ignoring the keyboard warriors, where no matter how much sense you make they love to flame anyway, I address the real gamers that live here and the people with an ounce of respect for themselves and, mainly, others.\n\nI understand the frustration of when something is wrong that you spent your hard earned cash on. The temptation to shout and smear is massive. Though if you step back and reverse those roles, if you have worked your socks off on something and someone else trashed you personally and crapped all over your hard work, would you be willing to just kowtow and apologise profusely and promise to do much better? Probably not, you would flame back, after being so insulted what else could you do? Then we get the posts of flaming that really benefit no one - not even the person whose initial complaint starts the process, as nothing will get fixed.\n\nSo how do you do it, how do you get your point across and benefit?\n\nWrite your post in the manner that you would talk to someone, face to face, without a keyboard and monitor between you. Respect the hard work of others and voice your criticism in  a more constructive way. Write in a way you would expect someone to talk to you. Think, if someone said this to me, how would I act?\n\nWe have all flamed in the past, myself included. Though it didnt help me. Has it ever helped you to resolve your issue?\n\nWhats better:\n'This game $%^&%$^ suks. Fix this piece of trash now or $%&^%$ refund!!!!!!'\n\nOr this:\n'Struggling with this game. I have tried x & y, but still can't z. Is this an issue with anyone else?'\n\nI know which one I would reply too. How about you?\n\nPoint is, keep it to the point, describe your issue and what you may have done to counteract it. Ask if this is similar to other folks and if anyone knows how to fix it? There is no need for personal attacks. \n\nBig companies, like CO, are faceless. Attacking a big company like CO is pointless as they will not respond, its a company. Even their employees, as with any company, talking on behalf of a company isn't allowed (for obvious reasons)\n\nCompany employees, however, will help someone out either publicly or behind the scenes if their issue is genuine and would shine a good light on their work\/company. More chance of getting your issue resolved. Though in gaming, gamers themselves will also gladly help out a genuine call for aid if they can. Though if it is littered with expletives, flame and pointless information, then why would they even bother?\n\nFinal point, lower the aggression, lets try and fix, together as a community, what we can and the rest we ask the devs to fix in a constructive request that respects both yourself, as a seasoned PC gamer, and the hard working developer who is trying their best to bring a new generation gaming experience to your monitor screen!",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540051992985616390/

Building vacancy overlay to help with demand,flick.flixmine,0,"So much of my demand is affected by having empty buildings but it takes absolutely forever to go through each building and see if its empty (because they aren't filling up even when I have really high demand) Could we get a vacancy overlay so you can quickly see where buildings are vacant and also easier identify trends causing vacancy?

I went thru every option - one at a time and got the game running pretty good with good graphics and performance ( some settings on High some on Med. and a few deactivated -for now ) Found that setting shadows to low solved quit a few of the graphics issues.  I have a medium PC with just a bit above required min specs. \n\n I am always amazed with what modern games and computers can do.

Found a repeatable condition that significantly affects performance - Train Routing,SharpSh00tah,0,"First and foremost, love the game, can't wait to see where this goes. The game condition is what it is, and i'd love to help make it better. I am a mechanical engineer with plenty of coding\/robotis\/circuitry exp in diagnostics\/logic etc... \n\nSO,\n\nIf you have a condition where the trains lock up due to over usage, the game starts to shudder noticeably worse until the line condition is cleared. Usually this is deleting the tracks, or the line. I've repeated this numerous times. 415k pop $1.5bil\n\nif the line is edited, and the end result has the train on the opposite tracks, the routing logic brings inbound trains to a stop, therefore train traffic builds up, resulting the same condition as above. \n\nIf the active, on-track train, needs to re-route due to anything, the game performance is  dropped significant enough to be linked as a major cause of CPU load. The problem is then multiplied as the resultant stopped trains are further affected as the user attempts to fix the tracks or line, making the feedback loop worse. \n\nThe actual trains also seem to take MUCH longer to self-delete than other modes of transport. \n\nlastly, once this condition clears, the game is MUCH smoother, and crisp. As I was watching the events unfold, the change was very obvious and apparent. This is what I saw live and made me notice the link in the fist place. Then, I got myself into the same situation due to bwain-ded and again took the performance hit. 2nd time made me keep it in the back of my head.\n\nThis morning, I changed the local road layout, and that changed the tracks, and the 3rd time the same condition appeared. So i'm writing this ticket while the situation clears. \n\n<3\n\nHope this helps!",https://steamcommunity.com/app/949230/discussions/0/5540051992986538005/

Zones with building options to create our own unique parks and airports?\n2. Why didn't you do a region map with several cities to manage interconnections and trade?\n3. Why did you release with so few mass transit options?\n\nYou had a chance to make a better game not just a nicer looking copy of Cities 1 vanilla so you can fleece us all over for the next years with DLC. You had the chance to start at maxed out Cities 1 and then use innovation to take the game ever further with even better DLC. Did you not learn from the death of Sim City?

Game randomly freezes on laptop,zenful6219,2,"Despite the latest Cities Skylines II patch, my three-year-old Dell G7 gaming laptop still outperforms my new Alienware M16 laptop in terms of gameplay.\n\nWith a 15K population city, my old laptop delivers around 30 FPS when zoomed in close to the maximum level. When zoomed out, the FPS drops to around 15 FPS. The game runs smoothly without any freezing. On the other hand, my Alienware M16 laptop experiences random freezing episodes that can last up to 30-45 seconds. These freezing issues never occur on my old laptop.\n\nWhen I first installed CS II on my old laptop and ran it for the first time, I used CO's recommended graphics settings. I followed the same procedure on my M16. However, using the same game save on the M16 results in the aforementioned random freezing. While the game runs at approximately 110 FPS when zoomed in to the same level as on the old laptop, the FPS drops to around 30 FPS when zoomed out.\n\nAutosave has never been enabled, which CO has identified as a potential cause for such issues. I'm baffled as to why the game freezes on the new laptop. I've filed a crash report with CO, even though the game isn't crashing, as they recommend this type of report for performance issues. I don't have high hopes for a resolution, but we'll see.

So pretty clear that people are upset about performance, economy and garbage bugs, but aside from that, what do you think is missing from City Skylines 2 that you expected? \nFor instance:\n-Inability to make dedicated turning lanes. One of the core features of TM:PE was the old shift-click at intersections, but that didn't make its way in to the new version.\n-Inability to disable street parking. With parking and street modification becoming a thing, find it weird that this isn't.\n-Disable zoning on roads. They put this in a recent patch of CS1 and its great.
