Denis the Menace , a very Iconic character from the old days with an antagonist that is not so much different then what this game has.\n\nseriously , this game should have been more about the neighbor himself and how you can interact with him , annoying him , playing pranks on him then about some weird puzzles and mistery that only a few fans will care about.\n\neven in the second game demo I've seen the same flaws , puzzles and puzzles with a neighbor that could be completly removed without changing the gameplay itself much.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/521890/discussions/0/3820796493689125969/

(However this is not really good since leaving the bed will take you back outside)\n\n[h1]Bypass Instant Death Start[\/h1]\n  By using the methods listed above you are able to lock the neighbor out of the back portion of the house making yourself unreachable. You activate the event by backing into the door of the room next to the basement door. (Video Shows better than I can describe)\n\n[h1]Neighbor Grabbing Through Walls[\/h1]\n  Normally happens when clipping or really close to a door thats locked.\n\n[h1]Game Save Point[\/h1]\n  Once the neighbor has started to grab you hold either 'z' or 'c' and DO NOT LET GO until you see your bed. It will send you back to your location of the last peek.\n\n[h1]Bypassing Nightmare[\/h1] -- Side bug the music stops after awhile? No Loop\n  Due to the bug above you are able to escape the nightmare glitch and have free roam of the nieghbor's house to unlock the pesky basement door! (The event trigger is at the window) So when you die and teleport back to the last location you never start the event. The neighbor does not move (He is actually a part of the giant neighbor)\n\n[h1]Out of Bounds[\/h1]\n  Weird bug with the ctrl crouch jump using flower pots. Mix of Shift + Space + Control can make you fly out of the bounds and allow exploration of other houses.\n\n~Note to developers I also saw the underground buried house what is that!\n\nNOT SHOWN IN VIDEO\n\n[h1]Code Constant[\/h1]\n  The code is always in the same place and the same code. (Once and done game)\n\n[h1]Invisible Barrier[\/h1]\n  Once there is a wardrobe leaned against the back of the house. You are able to jump above the window and reach a barrier under the balcony that wraps around part of the house.\n(This seems like where there is a balcony there is a barrier but cannot fully test)\n\n[h1]Beating the game in less than two minutes **SPOILERS**[\/h1]\n[url=https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZSdJY8l3y9E] Video Link[\/url]",https://steamcommunity.com/app/521890/discussions/0/340412122419666553/

True Genius of Hello Neighbor,mdesaleah,0,"The true genius of Hello Neighbor is not clear from just playing it a bit. No. It comes from experiencing the entire thing. From wandering each of the houses, to stacking boxes for sequence breaking, Hello Neighbor is not just any other game, its an experience. The emotions you feel from completing this experience are hard to describe with words. You've just spent the last 7-10 hours in a maze and once you are met by the infinite scope of its credits you realize just how much time you wasted playing a rushed game made to cash in on a trend. Nothing redeemable. Yet the \""you\"" who have fully experience this underrated gem, wasnt really you. Neigh, the TRUE genius of Hello Neighbor is never playing it at all.",https://steamcommunity.com/app/521890/discussions/0/3734078642265702455/

"Okay this is driving me mad - Act 3, Red Key",Melony,45,"EDIT: So, for starters, PLEASE NOTE that GETTING THE GUN TO THE \""NO GUN\"" ROOM IS ALREADY SOLVED, THAT IS *NOT* WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED IN THIS THREAD. Thank you =3.\n\nI'm seeing EVERYWHERE that people are just using cheaty\/glitchy ways to get the red key. As far as I'm concerned this is pure BS. The game is NOT meant to use its glitches to get something done - stacking boxes up somewhere is one thing, jumping on side pipes and climbing them, etc etc, but THROWING ITEMS THROUGH A CAGE is NOT the way it's supposed to be done.\n\nSO HOW IS IT *SUPPOSED* TO BE DONE? I can not find a SINGLE person who has done it ANY kind of \""legit\"" way.\n\nThe ONLY candidate I witnessed was when I actually saw someone - they shot all the targets in the room, which obviously causes the box to open so they could pull the lever, but all the cages come down around the WHOLE ROOM. You can flip the switch and unlock the key, but if you press the red button by the back door to open everything back up, it undoes the switch attached to the key.\n\nThe ONLY possible legit scenario I saw was, someone did this, got stuck in the room - and then LET THE NEIGHBOR CATCH THEM THROUGH THE BARS. Is THIS how it's *actually* supposed to be done?? I tried jamming the doors with objects to see if the fences wouldn't come all the way down and that didn't work. I can't possibly think of anything else ----\n\nWait, I JUST had a potential brainstorm. MAYBE after switching the switch, you can SHOOT THROUGH THESE particular fence bars and hit the key, knocking it off of its ring, and then you can reset the room???\n\nI'm gonna give this a shot.\n\nEDIT: Nope, this doesn't work.\n\nSeriously please tell me someone has input.\n\nEDIT, 2020:\nSo, as of RIGHT NOW, the CLOSEST POSSIBLE legitimate method appears to be a method I'm giving full credit to o0Champ0o for giving us. They said,\n\""Ok...I THINK I did it in a glitchless way and even then, Im not sure if thats what the devs had in mind:\n-Shoot all the targets and put the gun down\n-Press the button that resets the gates\n-As soon as I pressed the button, walked backwards and pressed the switch before the box closed\n\nIt STILL doesnt feel like that was what you are supposed to do but really, I couldnt find another way so...as far as for glitchless ways to do it, currently this seems to be it.\""\n\nAnother idea I'd like to explore a little further, maybe with OTHER ITEMS? Is @Petu's more glitchy suggestion (but still viable, because the game DOES have you utilize this technique with the Moon and Sun doors):\n\""I found another glitchless way to do it. After you have shooted all the targets you first use the lever so that the red key cage opens. After that go to the left side of the lever cage and shoot an ammunition inside it, this way it will stay in that position and you can go pick up the key.\""\n\nThirdly, it was suggested by @Omega Nova0 to utilize the magnet. I'm counting this as an honorable mention, because I'm not sure HOW you'd utilize the magnet, and I'd like to hear more about this technique, because this one actually FEELS pretty legitimate, itself?\n\nAnother honorable mention would be @Gripss's technique wherein you keep doing it over and over until the game (for whatever reason) decides not to lower one of the gates for some reason. IF it doesn't lower a gate, I would ASSUME there was a REASON? But. I don't know.\n\n\nAgain: STILL searching for the thing that TRULY feels like a legitimate solve. At this point, EVERYTHING HAS a TRULY LEGITIMATE-FEELING SOLVE *EXCEPT* for this!\nAlso: As a quick little side-note, I tried TURNING OFF THE POWER and then doing all of this, but the gates aren't connected to the power grid, sadly. I'm not sure why that is. You'd think they would be. For shi*s and giggles, I'm going to try and turn off my OWN power over in MY HOUSE, too, JUST IN CASE, but I'm like 99.99999% sure that's going to do absolutely nothing. Also, I'm going to attempt to wedge items to keep the gate from coming down, or forcing it to pop back up-- maybe there's an item we don't realize exists that could keep the gates from coming down if its wedged in the way?? Like the \""scared\"" mannequin?? Or a chair?? Or I just... *I DON'T KNOOWW*\n\nALSO, just as a- another \""suggestion\"" - maybe.. different TIMES OF DAY would matter?? Maybeee.. the frozen room needs to be frozen, maybe it'll lock the gates in place somehow--?? MAYBE you actually have to do this whole room as early as possible because maybe when you're \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 around in the rest of the game, you actually make it possible for these gates in this room to trigger!? As in, the same way you drain all the water from the water room-- maybe you have to NOT trigger something somewhere and that'll keep one or more of the gates from falling?? For example, maybe retrieving the crowbar before you do this room causes one of the gates to fall later when it wouldn't earlier?? It'd be interesting to focus FIRST on THIS puzzle and solve as LITTLE AS POSSIBLE beforehand, and see if maybe not triggering an event somewhere else would keep one of the gates from shutting...\n\nFinally: Could the VALVE you broke off that pipe for the water room be used for something for this, maybe?? Just a thoery... I don't even know if that valve is used for anything, period.\n\nHas anyone waited the full time for the tree to grow in the full version?? >>;; could.. could that drop something we need for this??\n\n\nRight now, I'm liking @o0Champ0o's method the best of all, it FEELS the most legitimate, honestly. So I'm going to work this until I get that version done.\n\n\nONCE AGAIN: EXTREMELY sorry for adding a wall of text to this. HOPEFULLY.. I don't know.. something happens with this friggin' puzzle, eventually. It's been YEARS, now, I would HOPE we'd have a LEGITIMATE SOLVE by now!\n\n\n\n***EDIT 2, 2020: SO; I am marking o0Champ0o's post as the answer to this, because it feels like the MOST LEGITIMATE way to do it (FOUR YEARS LATER. FOUR. YEARS. LATER.)\n\nI do want to, however, make one note to add on to o0Champ0o's post, for anyone that reads this:\nPersonally, I had the SWITCH version, which makes it a lot harder to turn the camera exactly where you want it to go to click on buttons and things, especially if you turn down the look sensitivity like I had to do.\n\nMy suggestion for this is to do like I did and, instead, equip the gun. Go forward and press the red button, then hold sprint and run backwards as quick as possible while firing and turning toward the lever as it SLOWLY shuts its cage. It DOES seem to shut the cage particularly slow, so maybe this WAS the legitimate solve. I don't know, and I don't think we ever will.\n\nI also want to note that this took me an ACCUMULATED about 30 tries. When I started to get really good at the end, I could hit the trophies every time very quickly, so in the last like 5 times I REALLY tried HARD, that was when I finally achieved it. One of the bullets happened to smack into the lever just before its cover shut all the way and voila, I had access to the red key.\n\nAlso, another note for this particular solve: If you're going to do it by shooting it with the gun, I suggest you just leave the lever switched to having the red key box locked, because you wouldn't want to risk accidentally triggering it BACK again just in case, and also, I think you might NOT BE ABLE to trigger it again WHILE its flipping the other way- so the game flips it, and that kills precious seconds you can shoot and force it to trigger again before the cover shuts.\n\nHOPE this HELPS for people who actually CARE about this sort of thing! And MANY THANKS to all the people who continued to visit this thread and talk about this, EVEN FOUR YEARS LATER!!!\n\nSpecial Thanks and Shout-Outs go to\n@Gripss,\n@o0Champ0o\n\nGive these guys some love, they're definitely Hello Neighbor fans =D\n\nI'll still check my notifications for new messages here, but have a lovely year guys, don't let COVID bring you down~!",https://steamcommunity.com/app/521890/discussions/0/1733216261960465496/

Mods don't work?,Tsunami,3,"Hey, i finished the main game a while ago, figured i'd revisit this and give some mods a shot.

! Unreal Engine Missing Script,Metasploit,4,"I'm sure I found a bug\/glitch, but just thought I would throw this out there. I'm hoping this isn't a spoiler (does not sound like it)\n\nThis bug starts where the moving platform goes back and forth by using the code. If you jump to the platform between the door that leads to a dropoff and the track, look at one of the walls. You can crouch into it, which puts you under the escalators, nearby the lowest track station. Once there, walk to the end (4 feet or so in game) and you will see a back box. Look through this and you will see a circle with \""! Unreal Engine Missing Script\"" written on a red circle with white horizontal and vertical lines running through it.\n\nSo, as usual, I attempted to interact with it. Seems if you walk into it the game music turns to what sounds like electrical shorting. This teleported me to the back of a church, on a hill, surrounded by tombstones. I looked around and noticed I was very, very, far away from the neighbors house. I continued to walk to as many houses as I could. Found a lake with a boat, a few mills, a school (I think), and tons of scenery. My final act was to walk off the side of the world, to which, you keep falling forever.\n\n--As a side note, I am having a blast with the initial release. There are a lot of bug fixes as well as a TON of small refinements. Keep up the great work!\n\n----Also, found a white & blue mask, a record with JT (not sure how to play it just yet), and Voyager 1 (love it!).",https://steamcommunity.com/app/521890/discussions/0/1500126447393799291/

Puzzles are either a boring easy or a frustrating hard. The story is one of those \""kids die we're so edgy\"" storylines that we've been getting since 2014. Let's not forget that the idea of Act 3\/4 being a dream really makes it less scary. (I know FNAF 4 is also a dream but at least that's genuinely scary.)\n\nThe game also hasn't got a update since 2019.\n\nlet's not forget the bugs and glitches. The neighbor jumps around more than the House of Pain, he glitches through walls, and his \""traps\"" are pathetic. The upgrades in Act 3 have the same problem as the puzzles: they're either underpowered or overpowered. I've both watched and made game clips where you set up objects in the very beginning of Act 3 before picking up the letter, and when you pick up the letter the cutscene appears very buggy.\n\nOf course, there's the \""trash can glitch.\""\n\nThe character of the \""Neighbor\"" is okay, but the kills children plot + purple clothes + his backstory revolving around a child's death hints at something I don't want to say or I'll get insulted.\n\nthe YouTuber Easter eggs were unnecessary.\n\nputting the modding tools on Epic Games Store but not Steam where Hello Neighbor is actually sold is really stupid.\n\nthe achievements are really dumb, considering you require a tutorial or hacks to get. If it weren't for YouTube, I would have no clue on how to get \""Meet Joe Black\"" or the other achievements, speaking of which 99.9% of the achievements are based on going to out of bounds locations in Act 3.\n\nthe shadow man is a dumb idea. Why not keep it at the Neighbor? Then it would at least be a bit believable.\n\nthe books are far from awful. They're crap. They do nothing but give YouTubers to rant about.\n\nBiggest problem? The game lost its horror feeling.\n\nIt now looks like a Pixar movie, the sounds are awful (especially the chase music), the character designs are trash and, to quote PewDiePie, \""It's evolving, just backwards.\""",https://steamcommunity.com/app/521890/discussions/0/3111396383970184567/

Wow I hate this game -just ranting,jasonjackson1284,3,"Tell me how I spent 16 hours since purchasing yesterday and I still haven't beaten a kids puzzle game?  Now I understand sometimes we get a little stuck on something but I've watched a couple of playthroughs of Hello Neighbor literally pondering, \""How in h-e-double sticks would someone have thought to do that?\"" This game is maddening! Only in the beginning of the first act does the game give any indication of your objective and then you're just kind of left to figure out what you can and can't do, all the while this dude is chasing you. So not only are you left scratching your head but barely have time to think while being chased down by the neighbor. At some point I wish calling the police or leaving the guy alone is an option in the game because the amount of effort to break in and get caught repeatedly is aggravating and honestly I don't understand the motivation.  The game makes it feel like *I'm* the creep for not leaving this guy alone and busting up his windows.  I tried getting a refund but I got so caught up in trying to solve this thing that I played for too long,. I suppose that's what makes the game so addictive. I think it preys on how our minds feel the need to solve things.  Now I'm refusing to give up because I can't get my money back, Good thing I got it on the winter sale.

I initially purchased it directly from the developer, outside of this community. I repurchased it so that it could be properly integrated with the other games in my Steam Library. \nHere is where I made my big mistake:\nOnce the files were successfully downloaded and installed, I foolishly moved over the files from my old version of the game (so that I could preserve my saves) to the new game folder. I figured the game would update itself and correct anything I had copied over with an old file version.\nHowever, when I started the game I got this message:  \n\""Plugin 'LauncherChunkInstaller' failed to load because module 'LauncherChunkInstaller' could not be found.

Alpha 1 Lagging and Crashing,Dunn,6,"So the Alpha 1 version of Hello Neighbor has had some very serious optimization issues, and that's mainly because the graphics settings are restricted to four - \""Low, Medium, High, and Epic.\"" It also has a tendency to crash when Mr. Peterson starts to chase me.\nAs well as the fact that the hiding tutorial is broken now. He will not move whatsoever, thus softlocking the game.\n\n\nDevice Name \t        LAPTOP-OQFN6MS6\nProcessor \t\tIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz 2.90GHz\nInstalled RAM \t        16.0 GB\nSystem Type\t        64-bit operating system, x64-based processor\nPen and Touch \tNo pen or touch input available\n\nI also have a total of ~1 TB of storage on my computer. 364 GB used with 553 GB available.\n\n\nWINDOWS SPECS:\nEdition\t\tWindows 10 Home\nVersion\t\t1803\nInstalled on\t5\/16\/2018\nOS Build\t\t17134.407\n\n\nIt might have to do with the Post Process (motion blur) and shadows, which I've always turned to low or off in other games since they do not work well. But in Alpha 1, you know, you can't adjust certain settings individually.\n\n\nI ran some FPS tests on Alpha 1, all other programs closed except for Steam (I turned on their FPS counter to help me determine this):\n\nLOW QUALITY:\n60-62 FPS both ways\n\nMEDIUM QUALITY:\nLooking at home ~ 34-38 FPS\nLooking at Neighbor's house ~ 16-22 FPS\n\nHIGH QUALITY:\nLooking at home ~ 20-24 FPS\nLooking at house ~ 11-14 FPS\n\nEPIC QUALITY: (my computer is dead at this point)\nLooking at home ~ 11-14 FPS\nLooking at house ~ 7-9 FPS\nGlitches with the textures and models also occur here.\n\n\nI also thought it might be the size of Mr. Peterson's house and the amount of items in it, so I took the task of emptying the entire house and putting the stuff in my front lawn. Played this on medium graphics, and then it was 28-30 FPS both in home and at his house.\n\nThe results are all the same even when I have like a thousand programs open, and when I go to Task Manager and set the priority of the .exe to High and Realtime. It's all the same.\n\nSo I'm wondering if there's anything to fix this for my computer, or if it's just the way it is with this version, [b] as well as Alpha 2 and the full game as well!

Act 3 crashing,FantasticFinn,0,"So, I was playing Hello Neighbor and once I got up to the cutscene of the neighbor locking his basement my game crashed and had a fatal error.

Questions regarding the game,_ShâdowyLight_,2,Hello!\n\nMy younger brother has asked me to about this game. He's really interested. I wanted to make sure the game was suitable for him before buying it. I was also curious as to why the game has bad reviews.\n\n1) The game refers to itself as a horror game. Just how scary is it?\n2) I've also noticed the game has very mixed reviews. I remember this game being talked about quite a bit when it was still being developed. What happened? Is the end product not as promising? Worth the money or no?\n\nThanks in advance!,https://steamcommunity.com/app/521890/discussions/0/3055112065879627809/
