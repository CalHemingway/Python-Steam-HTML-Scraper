The Talos Principle 2,Puzzle,THE LAW,0,PINNED:Encountered progress blocker or softlock? Read here!,en,-,"Hey folks! 
While we're on the hunt for those sneaky blockers and softlocks, striving to patch them up as fast as possible, there's always a chance you might stumble upon one. We've put together a handy guide that could assist you in resolving such issues, so why not give it a read? 

If any progress-blocking\/erasing situation happens to you, please still make a thread about it on the ""Tech Support and Bug Reports"" forum.
Describe the issue you have encountered and attach your save game, located in
[code]...\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Talos2\Saved\SaveGames\[\/code].
The save file is named [i]savedata_0\/1\/2.sav[\/i], depending on which game slot card you are playing on. Please upload it to any file hosting service (e.g. Google Drive) and link in the report.
This will help us locate the issue and fix it so that it doesn't happen in the future.

After that, here are your options of un-locking or restoring your playthrough:

[h3]If you have encoutered a situation where you think the further progression is not possible, but your save file is intact[\/h3]

Use any of the two following methods of unlocking a ""Load checkpoint"" menu:

[b]Method 1:[\/b]
1. Go to the Main Menu
2. While in main menu, press the following key combination on the Numpad (make sure that Num Lock is in the proper state and no buttons are selected): [b]4 6 4 9 7 9 9 9[\/b], that's 8 keys.
2*. If you're playing with a gamepad (either on PC or on console), the gamepad combination is as follows: [b]LB RB LB RT LT RT RT RT.[\/b] Also 8 keys, should also be pressed in the main menu.
3. After doing this, open the Play menu. On your savegame, you should be finding a new button called ""Load checkpoint"".

If this didn't work, 
[b]Method 2:[\/b]
(1) Close game
(2) Open game properties in Steam and in the Launch Options add the following line:
[code]-ExecCmds=""Talos.ShowLoadCheckpointMenu 1""[\/code]
Then launch the game and you should see that ""Load checkpoint"" menu.

After unlocking the ""Load checkpoint"" menu using any of these two methods, use it to restore an older checkpoint.


[h3]If your save file has visually disappeared, or has been randomly reset to the start of the game[\/h3]

1. Close the game
2. Locate the save file folder 
[code]...\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Talos2\Saved\SaveGames\[\/code]
3. Move your current save file out of it. If you are playing on the first save slot card, that is the file [i]savedata_0.sav[\/i], if you're playing on the second card it is [i]savedata_1.sav[\/i] etc.
4. Locate the backup save files associated with your playthrough, e.g. if you are playing on the second save slot card, they should be named [i]savedata_1_backup_0.sav[\/i] and [i]savedata_1_backup_1.sav[\/i].
5. Rename the most recently changed backup file between these two to [i]savedata_1.sav[\/i].
6. Launch the game again, your save should be restored to a slightly outdated backup point.
7. If this somehow didn't work, try also renaming the other backup save file.",en,-,"PINNED:Encountered progress blocker or softlock? Read here!Hey folks!

So what seems to me to be happening, is that Vsync and FPS limit apply to the ""real"" rendered frame, and not to every displayed frame (rendered or generated by FG). Is that so?

I think so because setting the FPS limit to 30 yields a stable 60 FPS in game, so one generated frame per rendered frame. Correct? This also fixes the input lag I saw, because I was actually hitting a CPU bottleneck and computing more frames that necessary (i.e. more than my actual refresh rate), which is a waste.

I would suggest that Vsync and FPS limit apply to all displayed frames (rendered normally or by FG), if that makes sense.

Other than that, great feature!

I found the green emitter in S1 and managed to connect it to the connector on the high rock just outside puzzle 2. Then got stuck and was wandering around.

But I am 99% sure I'm not supposed to do that, mostly because I don't think you're supposed to get the connector out of Switcheroo at all. It was kind of jank. I just stood on a box at the furthest edge of the platform holding the flame emitter and took a running leap at the entrance.

Hi. I'm really liking the game and hope someone on the dev team can see this but for my money, there's a few problems with the game I would at least like to know are being worked on

-Conversation closeups cause severe ghosting on almost any upscaling option. DLAA seems to be the only way to really mitigate them. It's really annoying
-Framegen still cannot be enabled on current Nvidia drivers :(
-Performance fluctuates too heavily in the open enviroments. (9900KF, 4080) I hope this can be improved.

The Talos Principle 2,Puzzle,Meme,0,"Frequent crashing on startup, changing zones and restarting the puzzles happening more frequently as the game progresses",en,-,"Hi devs,

I love the game but I have a huge issue with it.

This was not the case when I just started playing, the game was as smooth as butter and everything was fine.
However as my playthrough continued (around the 4th or 5th zone perhaps) the game has gotten barely playable.

Basically what happens is whenever I start the game without win 8 compatibility it crashes. So I launch it with win 8 compatibility.

After the game launches there's like 20% chance I will get to the main menu (It very often crashes again on epileplsy warning).

If I manage to get lucky I get to the menu screen, the game often crashes there as well but If I am lucky it will enter this dizzy mode of displaying main menu at a very low stuttery framerate (around 5 fps).

I have to wait in this dizzyness state in the main menu for about a minute or so and then the fps stabilizes at 120. Only then I am allowed to play the game.

However the issue does not stop there, when I finally manage to enter the game it is still not working properly. Whenever I enter a puzzle I am forbidden from holding X to reset it as it is guaranteed to crash it.

Also whenever I change zones there is like 90% chance of the game crashing which is giga annoying since I am on the golden gate puzzles at the moment - which as you know require frequent zone changes.

I am on a brand new desktop PC and all the other games work fine.

1. navigating through menu and changing settings isn't possible, because controller buttons don't do what they say. For example using the shoulder buttons to navigate to different menu tabs doesn't work, so there's no way to access those settings.

2. in-game controller layout is a bit odd. For example 'run' has been moved from left trigger (which has been 'run' in every game for as long as I can remember) to the right shoulder button, which is pretty awkward to use. 

I'd love an easy way to go back to the ""classic"" layout from the first game, which I found much more intuitive. Is there any reason why the old layout wouldn't work? Like are there extra controls that just wouldn't fit in the old scheme?

Beyond the layout, controls are a bit clunky in general. Even a small thing like putting puzzles together seems slow and awkward, compared with the original game where everything just worked. Not sure if that's another controller-specific issue?

3. engine is jittery and glitchy, which is giving me some motion sickness. I have a new-ish computer with decent specs - 13700k, 4070ti, 32GB 5600MHz DDR5, installed on NVMe M.2 SSD - so I expected a better experience in the graphics department - is there an optimization patch in the works?

First, screenshots with descriptions. If some of these problems have already been fixed - sorry. 
1. The subtitle text creeps out from the black stripe at the bottom into the cutscene area, although in theory it should all be placed only on it.

2. The blue emitter continues to flash through the wall even though there is nothing connected to it. This only happened once in the entire game.

3. In S1 in the southern “delta” and in W1-4, approximately the same bug occurred: devices begin to hang in the air if what they were standing on is removed from under them. 
https:\/\/steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net\/ugc\/2215269478445691598\/6BBB0F8FFAD2F6D1D6377AAF97DC5354C55BF3FC\/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false

7. Here you can jump over the wall on the rock and get to the pedestal without even thinking about solving the puzzle. By the way, when I returned, everything was closed, as if I hadn't solved the puzzle.

8. This happened in W2-4. In theory, the grate should have pushed the platform back or forward, but this did not happen. 
https:\/\/steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net\/ugc\/2271565016371568950\/2EDE1A9C516149C254FECADFD6ACC6E6CC6FCCA6\/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false 
9. End of the game, I wanted to approach the arch and build a bridge, but for some reason the force barrier turned on, losing contact with the red emitter. And now there was no way out of here. The only thing that saved me from the softlock was restarting the location.

11. Deer on N3 often run in close groups along the same route. It looks even a little creepy. And their stomping can be heard too well - even in underground laboratories. 
https:\/\/steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net\/ugc\/2271565016390504284\/176531CD1C1074A3D5AEF25EC56852F7941B374A\/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false

12. At different locations, devices with rotating parts may stop rotating. I noticed this on N3 and S2. 
13. All trees with light bark in the Megastructure have the same animation (which starts if you hold your gaze on them) swaying in the wind as the plants in the locations outside. It looks strange and even a little creepy. And, to be honest, it doesn’t look very good on ordinary plants either. It would be great if this animation could be disabled. 
14. In S1-8, the hint for jumping from the cube to the platform in front of the pedestal works crookedly. The orange feet sometimes don’t appear at all, sometimes somewhere on the side, usually on the left - next to the red receiver. And because of this, you have to jump at random. 
15. In S3-5, while the platform is moving, the hero can pass through the bars installed along the edges and fall into the water. If you had a connector in your hands at that moment, you will have to restart the location. 
16. If you put a connector between the power barriers in the ""golden"" puzzle at E3, then when you try to take it the hero will take extra steps, as if the device was standing too far away. It is unlikely that you will be able to get the connector on the first try. 
17. In Utopia, you can walk along the cornice protruding above the water directly to the second pedestal. 
••• 
18. Add the ability to enable the background for the compass. Because small compass symbols are generally hard to see, and especially hard to see when there is a bright picture on the screen. 

19. Add a constantly glowing outline around the clone's silhouette. Because the gray silhouette of a clone is sometimes difficult to see, especially among gray walls and at a great distance. 

20. Photos of the images on the Sphinx monuments, which 1K takes, are of rather poor quality, and they are not full screen, but at best 1\/8. It was easier for me to take a photo on a tablet and check it with it. And if it were possible to display a photo on the screen so that you don’t have to go into the interface, that would be absolutely wonderful. 

21. The opportunity to start the race again with the “spirit” of Prometheus. Sometimes, if you lose sight of it, you can get tired of looking for it.

17. In Utopia, you can walk along the cornice protruding above the water directly to the second pedestal. 
••• 
18. Add the ability to enable the background for the compass. Because small compass symbols are generally hard to see, and especially hard to see when there is a bright picture on the screen. 

19. Add a constantly glowing outline around the clone's silhouette. Because the gray silhouette of a clone is sometimes difficult to see, especially among gray walls and at a great distance. 

20. Photos of the images on the Sphinx monuments, which 1K takes, are of rather poor quality, and they are not full screen, but at best 1\/8. It was easier for me to take a photo on a tablet and check it with it. And if it were possible to display a photo on the screen so that you don’t have to go into the interface, that would be absolutely wonderful. 

21. The opportunity to start the race again with the “spirit” of Prometheus. Sometimes, if you lose sight of it, you can get tired of looking for it.

Не обращайте внимание если есть какие-то помехи в видео, т.к. чтобы записать мне потребовалось понизить качество игры. Также хочу передать большое спасибо за то, что игра доступна через Nvidia GeForce Now. Итак, приступим:

1. Баг с лягушками. на видео фрагмент 0:00 - 1:17
ещё Скриншот - [url=https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/eju1eDr.jpg] Тык [\/url]
Юг. Переход 3. Там где можно увидеть лягушек. Возле них бревно и вот они могут забагаться и не перепрыгнуть.
Другой раз они могут находиться справа от бревна и благополучно перепрыгнут. Но вот и такое бывает, что они застряли) Также если отойти совсем недалеко, то потом может появиться ещё одна лягушка (на видео 00:56), которая тоже не перепрыгнула.
[b]Решение: дать лягушкам перепрыгивать в воду:) Кстати их потом в воде уже не найти:D(( 
Не хотелось бы чтобы при этом бревно убрали.[\/b]

2. Баг HUD, отображения из-за фоторежима. На видео фрагмент 1:18 - 1:57
В настройках игры можно убрать весь HUD экрана, т.е. отображение компаса, целей, спрятать интерфейс. Но при заходе в фоторежим, а потом выходе - остается отображение слева вверху экрана (8 ловушек) и внизу слева. Получается фоторежим сбрасывает настройку отключения HUD. Что ещё может вернуть кроме фоторежима это отображение я не знаю. Убрать отображение можно нажав ESC два раза.
[b] Решение: сделать так, чтобы при выходе с фоторежима не возвращалось отображение на экране при отключении интерфейса\/целей в настройках игры. Также стоит проверить др. варианты, может что-то ещё возвращает.[\/b]

3. Баг - ПКМ мыши (правая кнопка мыши при взаимодействии с устройствами).
на видео фрагмент 1:58 - 2:20
Я надеюсь вы поймете о чем я. Постараюсь сам не запутаться.
ЛКМ - левая кнопка мыши
ПКМ - правая кнопка мыши
Разберем на примере коннектора. И что в итоге не так.

По ходу игры при нажатии ЛКМ берешь предмет. Выбрать объекты - Ещё раз на них попасть мышью - нажать ЛКМ чтобы выбрать и добавить в список активации коннектора. По направлении к земле ставишь предмет нажимая ЛКМ. С ЛКМ работает корректно. Дальше разберем с ПКМ.

Всё дело в том, что когда предмет активен в связях (на видео 2:11), чтобы сохранить связи и передвинуть в другое место ты нажимаешь ПКМ. Дальше чтобы с этими связями поставить предмет вот тут и начинается самое интересное. Ты можешь нажать ЛКМ, а можешь и ПКМ !
То есть я могу использовать правую кнопку мыши чтобы ВЗЯТЬ ПРЕДМЕТ, ЛКМ активировать связи , нажать ПКМ чтобы связи сохранить и поставить ПРЕДМЕТ НАЖАВ ПКМ !  (для отмены связей нужно зажимать ПКМ), а поставить просто НАЖАЛ И ВСЁ.
Также в подтверждение этому в настройках игры (на видео 1:58) и по существу ПОДНЯТЬ и в том числе ПОСТАВИТЬ актуально как для ЛКМ, так и для ПКМ.

В чём проблема?? А в том, что ПОСТАВИТЬ НА ПРАВУЮ КНОПКУ МЫШИ ты можешь, но не всегда. На видео вы слышите щелчки на 2:12 , 2:16 - это значит что не дает поставить. То так происходит не всегда. То есть порой надо нажимать много раз, чтобы в какой-то из них поставился предмет. Ты не меняешь позицию, ты поставить можешь, но ПОСТАВИТЬ БАГАЕТСЯ ПРИ НАЖАТИИ ПРАВОЙ КНОПКИ МЫШИ. ТО СТАВИТСЯ, ТО НАДО КЛАЦАТЬ МНОГО РАЗ, скажем на 5 или 10 поставится. Проблем с мышью нет.

[b]  Решение: Поддержка взятия объектов через ПРАВУЮ КНОПКУ мыши есть и ПРЕДМЕТЫ  СТАВЯТСЯ ЧЕРЕЗ ПРАВУЮ КНОПКУ МЫШИ ТОЖЕ.  Но нужна полная поддержка ПРАВОЙ КНОПКИ МЫШИ чтобы ставились с первого раза и не возникали такие щелчки.[\/b]",ru,Translation Failed,"3 бага (3 bugs): с лягушками; отображение HUD и ПКМ мыши с устройствами / with frogs; HUD; right-click for devices.Для всех трех багов записано одно видео (5 склеек коротких видео)[url=https:\/\/youtu.be\/7sWulU_wrZU] Тык [\/url]

The latest build on the main branch has launcher and in-game options that allow you to safely tweak these settings without editing the .variables file, it's recommended that you do that instead.

Also, there are various forum posts out there in which people have figured out how to edit even more settings. Be aware that doing so can break certain puzzles and game functionality in subtle non-obvious ways, which is why they're not included here.

If you want to suppress the launcher once you've got your settings how you like them, you can still do that via the launch options:

The Witness has a lot of settings under the hood that you can tweak, here's how:

First find your Local.variables file:

In Library in the steam client, right click on The Witness and go to: 
Properties -> LOCAL FILES -> BROWSE LOCAL FILES...
Go in into the ""data"" folder and open Local.variables in a text editor

There's a few things in there already, but ignore them, we'll just be adding new stuff.

Add a section for the Render Quality setting you want to edit, followed by the variables you want to set. You only need to add the variables you want to change.

Here's how it looks if you wanted to edit the high setting (the others are :\/render\/low and :\/render\/medium). These settings are the defaults for high:

[code]
:\/render\/high
low_res_reflections false
sun_shadow_resolution 1024
point_shadow_resolution 1024
antialias_panel_rendering true
skip_mipmaps 0
msaa_sample_count 4
aa_mode 2
panel_render_width 512
render_width 1920
render_height 1080
dynamic_resolution false
[\/code]

And here's what they do:

[list]
[*]low_res_reflections - pretty self explanitory, true or false
[*]sun_shadow_resolution - must be one of 256, 512 or 1024
[*]antialias_panel_rendering - true or false, improves the quality of the puzzle panels
[*]skip_mipmaps - 0, 1, or 2, changes texture resolution LOWER NUMBERS FOR BIGGER TEXTURES
[*]msaa_sample_count - 1, 2, 4, or 8. Higher numbers give better visuals at performance cost.
[*]aa_mode - 2 for FXAA, 0 for no FXAA. Other values are the same as 0
[*]panel_render_width - must be a power of two. I wouldn't go lower than 512. 1024 is nice if you've got a top end GPU
[*]render_width and render_height - the size of the backbuffer that's rendered to. Note that if you're using SET LAUNCH OPTIONS to set -width and -height, that'll override these.
[*]dynamic_resolution - true or false, reduce resolution dynamically to preserve framerate at the cost of (a lot of) visual fidelity. This is really a last resort to make the game run on low-end GPUs.
[\/list]


Save your changes, and then run the game in the Render Quality you edited!

And finally, if you think you've broken your game, or made it worse, you can just delete everything you added and it'll go back to defaults.

The Witness,Puzzle,The Invisibl,1,"PINNED:FAQ: Fullscreen, Borderless, Adaptive Sync, Microstutter",en,-,"[b]This FAQ applies to the Windows version only![\/b]

[b]Fullscreen Modes[\/b]

There were some small changes in the Jan 8 2018 update to make fullscreen play as nice as possible by default. Here I'll explain what the differences are, and how to tweak it if you want. When you select fullscreen in the launcher, the implementation you get depends on the version of Windows you have.

On any version of Windows 7, 8, or 10 [i]before[\/i] the recent Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, fullscreen mode will default to native fullscreen.

On the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and after, fullscreen mode will default to borderless windowed due to native fullscreen giving strange minimizing, alt-enter, and alt-tab behaviour on some systems.

If you don't know what version of Windows you're on, we write it out to the log file ([url=http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/210970\/discussions\/3\/458606877334686933\/]here's[\/url] how to find the log file). About 15 lines down, you'll see something like [i]""OS: Windows 10, PlatformId 2, Version 10.0, Build 15063""[\/i]. The Fall Creator's update is Windows 10 build 16299.

There's a third option for fullscreen, ""Flip Sequential"", that was introduced with Windows 8 for Windows Store apps. We never set it by default, but you can force it on if you like (see below). It forces Vsync on and may have other issues - we haven't done any rigorous testing on it because native and borderless windowed cover most people's requirements.


[b]Manually Forcing a Fullscreen Mode[\/b]

You can manually force a fullscreen mode through the Local.variables file:

In Library in the steam client, right click on The Witness and go to: 
Properties -> LOCAL FILES -> BROWSE LOCAL FILES...
Go in into the ""data"" folder and open [b]Local.variables[\/b] in a text editor.
You should see this section near the bottom:
[code]
:\/display
vsync true
[\/code]
Add this extra line underneath ""vsync true"" :
[code]
fullscreen_mode 0
[\/code]
The number after ""fullscreen_mode"" determines what you get:
[list]
[*] 0 is Native Fullscreen
[*] 1 is Borderless Windowed
[*] 2 is Flip Sequential
[*] ...anything else is invalid
[\/list]
If you request a mode not available on your version of Windows, it'll force something that is. You can check if it worked by looking in the log file just under the Windows version information. You'll see a line like ""D3D11: fullscreen_mode: requested 0, got 0""


[b]G-SYNC[\/b]

The default G-SYNC setting is to be enabled for fullscreen only. [i]Despite that, G-SYNC seems to work fine on borderless windowed in a lot of cases anyway[\/i].

However. if you have G-SYNC and it's not working for you (but working fine for other games), there are a couple of things to try:
[olist]
[*]Make sure you have V-Sync option turned [i]off[\/i] in The Witness launcher and\/or pause menu settings.
[*]It might be due to borderless windowed not playing nice with G-SYNC's fullscreen setting. You can change this in NVIDA Control Panel -> Display -> Setup G-SYNC -> enable G-SYNC for windowed and fullscreen mode.

I've seen various postings online with reports of this setting causing low frame rates and\/or mouse-lag artifacts with certain GPU driver versions and\/or certain Windows 10 updates. We haven't been able to reproduce any of these issues but it's something to be aware of.

If the setting causes problems for you, you could also make it apply only to The Witness by making a game-specific profile with a tool like [url=https:\/\/forums.geforce.com\/default\/topic\/926916\/3d-vision\/nvidia-inspector-gt-gt-gt-new-2-1-3-10-\/post\/5208633\/#5208633]Nvidia Profile Inspector[\/url]
[\/olist]


[b]V-Sync Options[\/b]

[i]This is old information and I doubt many people will need to make this change, but I kept it here for completeness:[\/i]

As of the 4\/4\/2016 update, we changed our default vsync implementation for Nvidia and AMD GPUs. In all our tests with latest drivers at the time this was much smoother, and plays nicer with adaptive sync methods to reduce microstutter. This did NOT affect Intel GPUs at all.

That said, if you find it was better for you before the update:
[olist]
[*]Make sure you have the latest drivers. Get them direct from Nvidia\/AMD's websites.
[*]If it's still no good, you can switch back to the old method:
In Library in the steam client, right click on The Witness and go to: 
Properties -> LOCAL FILES -> BROWSE LOCAL FILES...
Go in into the ""data"" folder and open [b]Local.variables[\/b] in a text editor.

I know this is probably too early in the lifecycle of this OS, but wanted to see if you were aware of any issues and if there is anything I can do to assist in finding a resolution.

Thanks!",en,-,"Anyone Running on MacOS Ventura Beta?Hi  Folks,

The Witness,Puzzle,VHenrik,1,Walking bug (win 11) the game walks by itself,en,-,"Hi! 
I have an issue where sometimes my character just keeps walking in one direction. So, for example, I'm pressing W, and then D too, and then poof, when I release my fingers it just keeps going either forward, or right. Sometimes double-tapping one of the WASD is enough to make it get stuck into a certain direction, and the same goes for pressing shift, it is exactly like it thinks that I'm still pressing the button, because when I press it again (the button which it thinks is stuck), it stops. 
I have win11 on my PC, but on my laptop I have win10, and I did not experience anything there, with the same keyboard. Then, I tried running the game in older windows compatibility mode, but that didn't do the trick. I also tried reinstalling and verifying the game, still nothing. Running as administrator and all that. 
I did not find anything online, and all the other games are just fine. I hope someone has some tricks for it, thank you in advance!

I have an issue where sometimes my character just keeps walking in one direction. So, for example, I'm pressing W, and then D too, and then poof, when I release my fingers it just keeps going either forward, or right. Sometimes double-tapping one of the WASD is enough to make it get stuck into a certain direction, and the same goes for pressing shift, it is exactly like it thinks that I'm still pressing the button, because when I press it again (the button which it thinks is stuck), it stops. 
I have win11 on my PC, but on my laptop I have win10, and I did not experience anything there, with the same keyboard. Then, I tried running the game in older windows compatibility mode, but that didn't do the trick. I also tried reinstalling and verifying the game, still nothing. Running as administrator and all that. 
I did not find anything online, and all the other games are just fine. I hope someone has some tricks for it, thank you in advance!

Found another discussion about the same issue:

[\/code]",en,-,"how to change which GPU is used?I have 2 GPUs in my machine:
- Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630
- NVIDIA GeForce GT 520

and i want the game to use the Intel GPU (since the nvidia is a potato). however, i cannot seem to force the game to use it. I have tried setting the windows 'Graphics performance preference' for the .exe to use the intel GPU, but it still does not work.

The Witness,Puzzle,RocketSword,0,Question about system requirements,fr,Question about system requirements,"Hi everyone,
so I have the thought of maybe buying this game. This is not a technical problem but I thought it may fit in this forum because my question is about the technical side of the game.

The Witness,Puzzle,ShortFuse,16,Command line arguments and config file variables,en,-,"[H1]CONFIG FILE[\/H1]

The basic config file can be modified with a text editor and is located in \/data\/Local.variables
Here are the internal defaults:

[B]Display[\/B]

[code]:\/display
[B]use_d3d9_ex[\/B] true
[B]max_frame_latency[\/B] 0
[B]vsync[\/B] true
[B]vendor_agnostic[\/B] false
[B]be_ogl_420_core_compliant[\/B] false
[B]show_config_dialog[\/B] true [i](set to false to skip startup launcher)[\/i]
[\/code]

There are also the following hidden variables

[code]
disable_topmost
debug_device
enable_d3d11_1
[\/code]

Also, worth noting is that [I]use_d3d9_ex[\/I] is never referenced by the game.

[B]Render Profiles[\/B]

You can add custom profiles while the config file includes baker, low, medium, high and ultra profiles. It seems you can create your own render profile and call it whatever you want.

The syntax is

[code]:\/render\/high[\/code]

Here are the variables in the game engine and in the config files.

[H1]Tips[\/H1]
If you want to start the game with Steam Link\/Shield TV or just don't want to start up config, add the show_config_dialog line in the config file and add -fullscreen to the start up",en,-,"Command line arguments and config file variables[H1]CONFIG FILE[\/H1]

The basic config file can be modified with a text editor and is located in \/data\/Local.variables
Here are the internal defaults:

[B]Display[\/B]

[code]:\/display
[B]use_d3d9_ex[\/B] true
[B]max_frame_latency[\/B] 0
[B]vsync[\/B] true
[B]vendor_agnostic[\/B] false
[B]be_ogl_420_core_compliant[\/B] false
[B]show_config_dialog[\/B] true [i](set to false to skip startup launcher)[\/i]
[\/code]

There are also the following hidden variables

[code]
disable_topmost
debug_device
enable_d3d11_1
[\/code]

Also, worth noting is that [I]use_d3d9_ex[\/I] is never referenced by the game.

[B]Render Profiles[\/B]

You can add custom profiles while the config file includes baker, low, medium, high and ultra profiles. It seems you can create your own render profile and call it whatever you want.

The syntax is

[code]:\/render\/high[\/code]

Here are the variables in the game engine and in the config files.

",en,-,"Black screen after launchingThe game used to work perfectly several months ago, but now, whenever I launch the game, I get a black screen (the game sounds play normally however).
My system is completely updated, and I’ve also tried updating my graphics card (edit: it's a [b] Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M [\/b]) drivers a couple of times now, but I just cannot make it work. 


Here’s my [b] log [\/b] and thanks in advance.

I'm experiencing some nausea after playing the game for a while. I read that increasing the field of view can help to alleviate that. On the Windows version at least, this seems to be possible by changing the fov_vertical setting in the misc section of Local.variables.

I have tried adding this setting to my Local.variables file, but this doesn't seem to have any effect. Adding ""show_config_dialog false"" does hide the configuration window when starting the game, so I am editing the correct file.

I'm running The Witness from the Epic games store. The Local.variables file is located here:

Only leaving the game will reset it. Am I missing something obvious?",https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/1679189548063953176/,20/04/19 07:34,18/01/2024 12:01:47,Bug Report,1

The Witness,Puzzle,nore,3,Symmetry puzzles are invisible,en,-,"First, thank you for making such a great game!
I am playing The Witness on Linux using Steam Play, and it works well. However, I just noticed that the symmetry puzzles in the glass factory, for instance, are completely invisible (see [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1621716053]screenshot[\/url]). This is unfortunately game-breaking since it makes it impossible to solve those puzzles...

I'm aware that the game is unlikely to be updated further, so, just wanted to know if there is anything I can do about that.

[\/code]",en,-,"Symmetry puzzles are invisibleFirst, thank you for making such a great game!
I am playing The Witness on Linux using Steam Play, and it works well. However, I just noticed that the symmetry puzzles in the glass factory, for instance, are completely invisible (see [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1621716053]screenshot[\/url]). This is unfortunately game-breaking since it makes it impossible to solve those puzzles...

I'm aware that the game is unlikely to be updated further, so, just wanted to know if there is anything I can do about that.

The Witness,Puzzle,segmentation fault,9,Graphical Issues after Dec 20 2017 Update,en,-,"Since the December 20, 2017 update, I have noticed some graphical glitches on my machine (windows 10) that were not there previously. Following are my explanations and some screenshots of the issues.

-----------------------------------

The first thing is a problem with water textures that make the water extremely over bright when viewing the polys from certain angles. This likely effects all water but it is most noticeable on water in dark places. 
Here are a few examples:
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1259194142
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584885
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584647
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584876

-----------------------------------

The next graphical issue has to do with shadows and lighting.
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584895

Notice the lack of shadows inside of this building:
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584960
The stone wall should be shaded by the structure but is still being lit by the sun. As you walk closer to the building the shadows appear. 

It is a little harder to express precisely what is going on in static screenshots as the effect is more pronounced when the player is moving around. I am not really set up to capture video so here are several screenshot sequences that I hope will get the point across.

Here I take a few steps forward, take a screenshot, and so on...

\/\/note: shadows around the player seem to be confined to a cube, can’t tell if axis aligned or not, anyway one of the corners is visible in the shadow of the palm.

http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282585037
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282585050

Later I noticed that moving the camera also has an effect on this lighting problem, not just player position.
In this sequence I stand still and move the mouse, panning the camera to the right:
\/\/notice the diagonal shadow line move across the light colored building.

http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584851
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584865

These lighting issues seem to be exclusive to above ground locations, that is, locations that are in contact with sunlight, but I could be wrong about that. (I have not looked at all areas of the game, nor have I attempted interacting with dynamic objects underground that would effect shadows)

There may be other subtle issues that I am not seeing, or maybe after looking for so long I am seeing things that look weird that are suppose to be that way. I can’t really tell if the puzzle panels are fine or not. Part of me thinks something is off, but I can’t put my finger on it. 
Here is a close up and distance view.

Anyway, I hope this helps. If you need anything more from me feel free to ask.
My computer probably falls on the low end of the requirements so I understand if this is not high priority.  This game has had a lasting impact on me, and is one of my favorites. Please accept a virtual high five to all of The Witness team.  

",en,-,"Graphical Issues after Dec 20 2017 UpdateSince the December 20, 2017 update, I have noticed some graphical glitches on my machine (windows 10) that were not there previously. Following are my explanations and some screenshots of the issues.

-----------------------------------

The first thing is a problem with water textures that make the water extremely over bright when viewing the polys from certain angles. This likely effects all water but it is most noticeable on water in dark places. 
Here are a few examples:

-----------------------------------

The next graphical issue has to do with shadows and lighting.
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584895

Notice the lack of shadows inside of this building:
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584960
The stone wall should be shaded by the structure but is still being lit by the sun. As you walk closer to the building the shadows appear. 

It is a little harder to express precisely what is going on in static screenshots as the effect is more pronounced when the player is moving around. I am not really set up to capture video so here are several screenshot sequences that I hope will get the point across.

Here I take a few steps forward, take a screenshot, and so on...

\/\/note: shadows around the player seem to be confined to a cube, can’t tell if axis aligned or not, anyway one of the corners is visible in the shadow of the palm.

http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282585050

Later I noticed that moving the camera also has an effect on this lighting problem, not just player position.
In this sequence I stand still and move the mouse, panning the camera to the right:
\/\/notice the diagonal shadow line move across the light colored building.

http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584851
http:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1282584865

These lighting issues seem to be exclusive to above ground locations, that is, locations that are in contact with sunlight, but I could be wrong about that. (I have not looked at all areas of the game, nor have I attempted interacting with dynamic objects underground that would effect shadows)

I'm pretty sure that in [i]every[\/i] crash log, the ""error : The D3D11 device in use has been removed. Reason: HUNG"" line is there. Not informed enough to know what that means in terms of troubleshooting. 

I've tried the following:
[list]
[*] Turning on SLI in my Nvidia settings, launching
[*] Turning it back off, launching
[*] Turning all my Nvidia settings to low, launching
[*] Turning them back to default, launching
[*] Reinstalling the game
[*] Running the ""future"" beta
[*] Updating my drivers through Geforce Experience and through the official Nvidia site
[*] Running as admin both the x64 exe and the non-x64 exe
[*] Picking all graphics levels, low lasts the shortest amount of time while high lasts the longest (~3 mins)
[*] Vsync on\/off
[*] Starting in windowed\/unwindowed, staying within each, and switching after starting with each
[*] Starting in lowered resolution
[*] Over\/underclocking with afterburner (this was when I first tried to get it to work, around half a year ago, so I don't remember the specifics. I could try again if it'd be helpful)
[\/list]

And none of the above had any effect whatsoever. I'm at the point where I'm hunting for a PS4 key, but the only option is paying another $40 bucks that I don't have right now, because all the cheaper key websites have unfortunately run out of them.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even if it's ""your GPU\/CPU\/Something else cannot handle this game,"" I'd be glad to know that's the problem.",en,-,"Crashing 100% of time w/in 3 mins of startup, SLI GTX750Ms, ""D3D11 Device Removed: HUNG""Hey guys, first off — thanks for doing so much maintainence and offering so much help on a game that's been out this long, I really appreciate it.

I'm pretty sure that in [i]every[\/i] crash log, the ""error : The D3D11 device in use has been removed. Reason: HUNG"" line is there. Not informed enough to know what that means in terms of troubleshooting. 

I've tried the following:
[list]
[*] Turning on SLI in my Nvidia settings, launching
[*] Turning it back off, launching
[*] Turning all my Nvidia settings to low, launching
[*] Turning them back to default, launching
[*] Reinstalling the game
[*] Running the ""future"" beta
[*] Updating my drivers through Geforce Experience and through the official Nvidia site
[*] Running as admin both the x64 exe and the non-x64 exe
[*] Picking all graphics levels, low lasts the shortest amount of time while high lasts the longest (~3 mins)
[*] Vsync on\/off
[*] Starting in windowed\/unwindowed, staying within each, and switching after starting with each
[*] Starting in lowered resolution
[*] Over\/underclocking with afterburner (this was when I first tried to get it to work, around half a year ago, so I don't remember the specifics. I could try again if it'd be helpful)
[\/list]

And none of the above had any effect whatsoever. I'm at the point where I'm hunting for a PS4 key, but the only option is paying another $40 bucks that I don't have right now, because all the cheaper key websites have unfortunately run out of them.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even if it's ""your GPU\/CPU\/Something else cannot handle this game,"" I'd be glad to know that's the problem.",-,https://steamcommunity.com/app/210970/discussions/3/1733212454825485116/,05/09/18 15:39,18/01/2024 12:01:57,Bug Report,2

Yesterday I installed the game and ran it, I played with no issues (not a very powerful PC, but I did set all to Low) and after about one hour I left the game.

However, today I tried to start it... and it didn't start: after showing the display settings window (and again setting everything to Low) I get this error: unable to set up display device. I've tried to check\/uncheck full-screen and v-sync, checked the integrity of the files... No success. 

As far as I know there have been no system updates between yesterday and today.

The Witness,Puzzle,NeoIbero,3,Black screen after configuration window,en,-,"I've just started The Witness and, after the configuration window appeared, all i got was a black screen. I could hear sound, but nothing else. I had to restart my computer. In my second attempt, the result was the same. Then i tried to leave the Full Screen option unselected, and i could see the game title and the options when the 'Esc' key is pressed.

Is there any way to execute the game in full screen mode properly?

Changing the configuration for all users solution that i read in other thread didn't work.",en,-,"Black screen after configuration windowI've just started The Witness and, after the configuration window appeared, all i got was a black screen. I could hear sound, but nothing else. I had to restart my computer. In my second attempt, the result was the same. Then i tried to leave the Full Screen option unselected, and i could see the game title and the options when the 'Esc' key is pressed.

Is there any way to execute the game in full screen mode properly?

The Witness,Puzzle,Memoria,1,Game freezes a few minutes after launch,en,-,"I put about 20 hours into this game with no problems, and now it freezes (frozen screen, stops responding) every time after a few minutes of playing. Nothing changed on my computer to make this happen; I hadn't updated anything. I was at least an hour into playing the first time it happened. Changing graphics settings has no effect. When it freezes also seems random.

I would really appreciate any help, as a I really want to finish this game!

Here is my system (it's an Alienware Alpha):

Windows 10, 64 bit
Intel Core i7-4785T CPU @ 2.20 GHz
8 GB RAM
GeForce GPU (that's all it says, it's special made for this computer)
200 GB free disk space

Nothing changed on my computer to make this happen; I hadn't updated anything. I was at least an hour into playing the first time it happened. Changing graphics settings has no effect. When it freezes also seems random.

I would really appreciate any help, as a I really want to finish this game!

Here is my system (it's an Alienware Alpha):

Windows 10, 64 bit
Intel Core i7-4785T CPU @ 2.20 GHz
8 GB RAM
GeForce GPU (that's all it says, it's special made for this computer)

The Witness,Puzzle,JeeRik,10,Unable to set up display device,en,-,"Hello,
I have a problem with my game. The notebook I am running is below the game requirements (namely GPU), but when I ran it for the first time, it ran without any problems (given that I do not consider low graphics quality a problem). After I played for some 4 hours and closed the game, I was not able to start the game since.
The error I get is ""Fatal error: Unable to set up display device"". It occurs right after I submit the initial configuration. I tried everything I figured out might help: Went through all combinations of options in the start menu (even tried higher graphics, just in case). I tried reinstall. Tried system reboot. Even the 32bit loader. Only thing I did not try is to delete the save files, as I could not find them.
How can I restore the state when the game ran?

First launch log (excluding the middle, as it corresponds to a 4 hour play):

[\/code]",en,-,"Unable to set up display deviceHello,
I have a problem with my game. The notebook I am running is below the game requirements (namely GPU), but when I ran it for the first time, it ran without any problems (given that I do not consider low graphics quality a problem). After I played for some 4 hours and closed the game, I was not able to start the game since.
The error I get is ""Fatal error: Unable to set up display device"". It occurs right after I submit the initial configuration. I tried everything I figured out might help: Went through all combinations of options in the start menu (even tried higher graphics, just in case). I tried reinstall. Tried system reboot. Even the 32bit loader. Only thing I did not try is to delete the save files, as I could not find them.
How can I restore the state when the game ran?

First launch log (excluding the middle, as it corresponds to a 4 hour play):

There's the occationaly tiny framerate ”hickup”, but nothing major. When the game was released I had some noticable frame rate drops when viewing certain areas of the game, but whatever the reason is, that seem to be gone. Think it might has been the first update (after release) that you did for the Witness, becase I remember there was a positive change already back when I tried that.

The Witness,Puzzle,sebdul,1,Ridiculous perf on 2016 Macbook Pro,en,-,"Hi!


I got the game recently and started playing it on a 2016 15"" MBP (i7-6820HQ, Radeon Pro 455). At first I played with medium settings and thought the framerate was bad, but later when I got to different areas I had to change graphics settings to low. Now that I've gotten into this village-like area, the game often drops to around1-2fps, and I also get these 5-second pauses where the sound also cuts out.

From this forum it seems like the game actually works ok on some Apple laptops, so I'm sure something's wrong. I have tried many different graphics setting combinations, and also changing the desktop resolution. I would have changed to playing on a PC long ago, only apparently I'll have to start a new game. :(

I got the game recently and started playing it on a 2016 15"" MBP (i7-6820HQ, Radeon Pro 455). At first I played with medium settings and thought the framerate was bad, but later when I got to different areas I had to change graphics settings to low. Now that I've gotten into this village-like area, the game often drops to around1-2fps, and I also get these 5-second pauses where the sound also cuts out.

From this forum it seems like the game actually works ok on some Apple laptops, so I'm sure something's wrong. I have tried many different graphics setting combinations, and also changing the desktop resolution. I would have changed to playing on a PC long ago, only apparently I'll have to start a new game. :(

First, I played the Whitness about an hour until now and I think it is AMAZING. The puzzles were intuitive and the overall atmosphere is great.

However, my game stutters awfully on my new RX580. I shouldn't be hardware related since I actually changend my card one week ago for a new one because I always get 100% fb-usage ( thats still the case btw). Other games run just finde and it is just a handful including The Whitness and Overwatch which let me to the conclusion that something in the programming of these games colludes with the 100% fb-usage I have on my card (overall usage is fine).

So what could I do about in in the settings of this particular game ? I own a 1440p monitor so setting the settings on low or mid really makes the game look awful and mushy. Any other advices ?",en,-,"Awful stuttering on RX580 -  what can I do ?Hello everybody.

I've tried lowest setting, highest settings, vsync on\/off, fullscreen off then alt+enter, running as administrator, reinstalling nvidia geforce experience and my nvidia drivers with multiple reboots to ensure SLI settings were correct, etc, etc.  I'm at such a loss now for what is wrong.

EDIT: So I did some digging and found out there was a missing redist. So i installed it (C++ 2013) and now I can launch the game from outside Steam in the game folder but not from Steam. I even tried reinstalling. It might not seem like a big deal to some because I can technically play the game but I picked the Steam copy rather than the DRM-Free copy for a reason so I hope someone can be of assistance.

I tried all of the typical fixes found in the forum and was able to remedy the issue by uninstalling both the Witness and Steam then reinstalling them. I then played for another 45 to 50 min. Now the error is coming up again. My log file is below.

",en,-,"Withess64_d3d11.exe stoped working problemHi, I was able to play the Witness for about 45min on the first install. When  I went to play the game again I started getting  Witness64_d3d11.exe error.

I tried all of the typical fixes found in the forum and was able to remedy the issue by uninstalling both the Witness and Steam then reinstalling them. I then played for another 45 to 50 min. Now the error is coming up again. My log file is below.

The Witness,Puzzle,strank,3,"Discrete GPU: Worked initially then ""No suitable display adapter found""",en,-,"Hi all

I'm on a Surface Book, so a laptop with an integrated and a discrete GPU, the latter being definitely strong enough for the game's requirements. The Witness ran perfectly two hours ago, now it doesn't start with ""No suitable display adapter found"".

There was no change in the software setup in these two hours. What changed is that, initially, when I first started the game, I had a second monitor attached. When it failed to start now, that monitor was not attached. Trying to trick the device creation code by now attaching (another) external monitor does not lead to a different result - it still fails with the same error message. As you can see in the log files below, the game does see the dGPU. If I force the executable to start only with the internal GPU, it does run - albeit badly.

Here's the failing log:

The Witness,Puzzle,Pesky,0,Mac version: Game sometimes doesn't register that lines are complete,en,-,"Mac version on very fast Mac, with a trackpad, current version of macOS.

About 1 time in 15, the game is not registering that I have drawn the entire line.  It acts as if I lifted off a pixel before the line was complete.  Once I was sure I wasn't getting the wrong solution I slowed down and took a look.  When a line is complete the game is meant to signal it by flashing the line colour a little.  Sometimes that doesn't happen.  I have to hold the button down for an extra second or two to make the line flash.  Happens equially on puzzle lines and environmental lines.

I'm comparing touch-and-feel experience with the Windows version of the game, running under Windows 10 on the same computer (Bbot Camp on another partition).  With the Windows version I can draw the line and lift off immediately and it works every time.  With the Mac version this sometimes doesn't work, and to make sure the game thinks the line is complete I have to hold down the button for a couple of seconds.

",en,-,"Game crashes when i exit the first tunnelMy game runs at about 400 fps in the tunnel (wich is a lot) but runs very stuttery. When i reach the end of the tunnel my game crashes and i get the dreaded ""witness64_d3d11.exe has stopped working"" message.
I've read that running the game windowed and alt-entering after startup fixes this, but it does not. I've tried all sorts of graphics menu tweaks but none of them work.

Now when I try to play the game, large chunks of the map appear completely invisible and sometimes cannot be walked on, rendering the game unplayable. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

The Witness,Puzzle,Coquinho,0,Game freezing at loading screen,en,-,"Hi,
I am enjoying the game so far, but after some days after the installation the game won't start properly.

Now, when I try to run the game, it keep stuck in the loading screen (that black screen with the symbols). In order to make the the game to work I have to try to run it dozens of times, in Window mode and press CTRL + Enter to enter Full Screen. I have tried with different quality settings, but I was not able to find a workaround. After several tries, the game eventually loads then I can run it normally, but it's really annoying. Sometimes I keep trying for 30 minutes :(

The Witness,Puzzle,Floyd,5,Freezing issues,nl,Freezing issues,"I'm having freezing issues in some places of the island. The game ran perfectly at the beginning (castle, orchard, peninsula, desert...) and around the island near the shores, but it has freezes and stuttering towards the center. (Japanese temple, meadow, orange tree forest, the town...)

I tested different graphic settings to see if it was of any help but, the game keeps stuttering the same way in given areas. I also emptied the game cache and reset the global settings in the Nvidia Control Panel as advised in another thread, but it didn't make any change.

I should also mention that my computer is running very slow for a little while each time I leave the game after experiencing the freezing\/stuttering.

It's a bit gamebreaking and I would definitly appreciate if it could be solved.

[\/code]","Freezing issuesI'm having freezing issues in some places of the island. The game ran perfectly at the beginning (castle, orchard, peninsula, desert...) and around the island near the shores, but it has freezes and stuttering towards the center. (Japanese temple, meadow, orange tree forest, the town...)

I tested different graphic settings to see if it was of any help but, the game keeps stuttering the same way in given areas. I also emptied the game cache and reset the global settings in the Nvidia Control Panel as advised in another thread, but it didn't make any change.

I should also mention that my computer is running very slow for a little while each time I leave the game after experiencing the freezing\/stuttering.

It's a bit gamebreaking and I would definitly appreciate if it could be solved.

The Witness,Puzzle,Catgirl Jessica,1,Question about error-checking (Spoilers),en,-,"I was hoping a dev could shine some light on a mysterious aspect of the game's error-checking feature. In the Marsh, the blue outline shapes are used to cancel out yellow shapes and they seem to follow a strict logical rule: [i]Blue outline shapes remove the shape indicated by the outlined shape from the solution of yellow squares, so long as they are grouped together in the same region.[\/i] 

This rule seems to hold true all of the time, however after doing some testing there appears to be an exception to the rule: [i]Should blue outline shapes reduce the number yellow squares to zero, then the region is free of the shape rules so long as the icons remain grouped appropriately.[\/i] Examples of this: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/kHss7QS.png and http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UAaFi5y.png Notice how the error-checking feature doesn't blink the blue outline shape and its yellow shape partner, even though they don't have the same shape and in the first case neither is slanted. However this exception only comes up when error-checking an invalid solution and it can't lead to a valid solution.

So my question is, why does the above occur?

1. The error-checking feature is faulty and fails to show an error, or doesn't check the full panel?
2. The blue outline shape algorithm has an unintentional exception and in order to get around this, the puzzles were designed so it could never be used?
3. The exception is intentional but was never utilized?
4. Some other reason?

The Witness,Puzzle,jalbenphillips,4,Fatal Error: No suitable display adapter found,ca,Fatal Error:,"I used to be happily playing The Witness on a laptop with Intel HD graphics, and at medium quality it actually ran fairly well, although stuttering a lot in complex environments.

Recently I picked up a new laptop with ""switchable"" graphics: it's an AMD A10 processor with integrated Radeon HD 8610G, plus a discrete Radeon R7 M260 and 2 GB video RAM.  The drivers are the latest AMD offers, and it's running on Windows 10 64-bit.

Starting The Witness gives me an error pop-up: ""Fatal Error - No suitable display adapter found"".  I checked the log file, and ""D3D11"" seems to only detect the integrated HD 8610G plus some ""Microsoft Basic Render Driver"", but not the R7 adapter.  But ""AGS"" detects the R7.

The Radeon settings are weird, but I've set it to ""high performance"" (as opposed to ""power saving"") for the witness_d3d11.exe and witness64_d3d11.exe applications, so it should be using the R7 for those.  I figure that adapter is sufficient for the game's requirements, if only the game would detect that it's there.

",en,-,"Fatal Error: No suitable display adapter foundI used to be happily playing The Witness on a laptop with Intel HD graphics, and at medium quality it actually ran fairly well, although stuttering a lot in complex environments.

Recently I picked up a new laptop with ""switchable"" graphics: it's an AMD A10 processor with integrated Radeon HD 8610G, plus a discrete Radeon R7 M260 and 2 GB video RAM.  The drivers are the latest AMD offers, and it's running on Windows 10 64-bit.

Starting The Witness gives me an error pop-up: ""Fatal Error - No suitable display adapter found"".  I checked the log file, and ""D3D11"" seems to only detect the integrated HD 8610G plus some ""Microsoft Basic Render Driver"", but not the R7 adapter.  But ""AGS"" detects the R7.

The Radeon settings are weird, but I've set it to ""high performance"" (as opposed to ""power saving"") for the witness_d3d11.exe and witness64_d3d11.exe applications, so it should be using the R7 for those.  I figure that adapter is sufficient for the game's requirements, if only the game would detect that it's there.

I'm unsure if my graphics are good enough and I'm not sure where to check. I do have enough  ram and such. If I need to install this on a better computer, it's not much of a problem, but my internet is very slow, so it will take like 6 hours, so I am trying to avoid it.",en,-,"Game launches but then crashes right after you startThe Witness - x64 - D3D11 - Final

Yes, I understand everything that was already said about it. That not all puzzles needs to be solved to complete the game, and that some puzzles are just not possible to amend for color blindess. 

But I still believe that at least some puzzles could be improved for colorblind people (not the bunker\/greenhouse, definitely, but some others).

The Witness,Puzzle,Kitty,4,Missing structures,en,-,"I've been having problems with Witness - it keeps forgetting to draw things. Big things - like buildings, or hills. Quitting and restarting solves the problem until I move to a new location, and then most of the new place is missing. (At the very start, the control panel next to the glittering wall was missing - took ages to figure that out)

I'm guessing this is because this isn't the latest machine - I've done the \/3GB thing, hidden the concurrent resource creation warning, and the logfile is a train-wreck! I've tried fiddling with all the options, but can't find one to fix this. Oddly, the game seems smooth and plays fine. Any suggestions?

Start of Logfile attached - it gets very repetitive and goes on for 800kb...

Any ideas? Even if its just how to force a reload without restarting the game?

",en,-,"Missing structuresI've been having problems with Witness - it keeps forgetting to draw things. Big things - like buildings, or hills. Quitting and restarting solves the problem until I move to a new location, and then most of the new place is missing. (At the very start, the control panel next to the glittering wall was missing - took ages to figure that out)

I'm guessing this is because this isn't the latest machine - I've done the \/3GB thing, hidden the concurrent resource creation warning, and the logfile is a train-wreck! I've tried fiddling with all the options, but can't find one to fix this. Oddly, the game seems smooth and plays fine. Any suggestions?

Start of Logfile attached - it gets very repetitive and goes on for 800kb...

Any ideas? Even if its just how to force a reload without restarting the game?

","FPS drops after 5 minutes or lessHey got this game with christmas cash and it's great, but after about 5 minutes of play regardless of graphical settings or anything else, the frame rate drops to about 15 fps. The gpu heats up but not beyond limits, just got an extra fan base for my laptop too. I am pulling my hair out because I want to be able to play this game unhindered by hw ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Any thoughts?

Most of the time, I can't launch the game. Steam indicates the game as launching, then nothing...

The Witness,Puzzle,Nicolas,8,Heavy stuttering while moving around the world,en,-,"When I move around the game freezes periodically... Like large fractions of a second. I think it has to do with streaming assets, since it seems to get worse as I move from area to area.

I tried running the game with task manager open on the side and didn't notice any particular CPU or GPU or RAM or disk spikes. Tell me if there's anything I can do to help narrow down the root cause of this performance problem.

By the way, I don't think this happened when I played the game at its original release. Seems like there was a performance regression either in The Witness or in some OS\/drivers. Or maybe my own computer got messed up somehow. :P

",en,-,"Heavy stuttering while moving around the worldWhen I move around the game freezes periodically... Like large fractions of a second. I think it has to do with streaming assets, since it seems to get worse as I move from area to area.

I tried running the game with task manager open on the side and didn't notice any particular CPU or GPU or RAM or disk spikes. Tell me if there's anything I can do to help narrow down the root cause of this performance problem.

By the way, I don't think this happened when I played the game at its original release. Seems like there was a performance regression either in The Witness or in some OS\/drivers. Or maybe my own computer got messed up somehow. :P

There's a new update in the ""future"" beta that contains (among other things) a workaround for the driver crash some people have been seeing (usually in the monastery) on Intel HD 4000 and similar GPUs.

If you're running into that issue, try it out. If not, I'd suggest waiting as we'll push the update to the main branch after a few days anyway (and swapping to a beta is a big download)

To swap to the future beta:
[list]
[*]Close The Witness
[*]In Library in the steam client, right click on The Witness and go to: 
[*]Properties -> BETAS
[*]Select ""future -"" from the dropdown
[*]There's no access code, it should start downloading straight away

Using Fraps or MSI After burner both say it renders at ~150 fps. I recorded some gameplay with Fraps at 120 fps and looked at it frame by frame in Windows Media Player (let me know if you have a better way to record frame time). Some times the game updated each frame of the video (at 120 fps), other times it was every other, and some times it was every third.

Can you help figure this out how to run this game smoothly at 120 fps?

The Witness,Puzzle,Ourob',2,Game crashes after video cinematic,en,-,"Hey! Awesome game already, looking forward to keep playing it, but I'm having an issue.

After watching the first cinematic (after puzzle ""credits"" part in hotel and void stuff), the game crashes and bring me back to almost the beginning (I left the game early to switch from ""high"" to ""medium"" quality in the launcher. When I start the game back it brings me at the place I left.)
Not much of loss but I don't rly want to try again until I know if there is something wrong or not ^^.

Here's the log.txt file :

Thanks in advance!",en,-,"Game crashes after video cinematicHey! Awesome game already, looking forward to keep playing it, but I'm having an issue.

After watching the first cinematic (after puzzle ""credits"" part in hotel and void stuff), the game crashes and bring me back to almost the beginning (I left the game early to switch from ""high"" to ""medium"" quality in the launcher. When I start the game back it brings me at the place I left.)
Not much of loss but I don't rly want to try again until I know if there is something wrong or not ^^.

Here's the log.txt file :

",en,-,"Game crashes after several seconds of playWas able to download the game fine, but it's now crashing after I begin moving around. Seems to be okay if I remain stationary, but once I start walking will crash after several moments. Trying to find out what the problem might be. Below is the log. Thanks.

I have two questions though and I hope this is the right place to ask.

1) The player 'height' or floor height seems wrong.  I'm about half as tall as I should be and have to look up all the puzzles like the slightly awed child I am! :D I've been through the Steam VR seated setup a few times recalibrating it but it doesn't seem to change the height, regardless of whether I am sat or not.

2) Is there a way to turn off comfort mode via some ini flag?  I find the fact you turn in set increments quite disorientating.  

Either way great game so far, and I hope there's some plans afoot to allow a little more configuration of the VR experience even if never officialyl supported and\/or made available via ini tweaks.  I for one would love VR + mouse\/key controls.",en,-,"Height problems in VR, 'comfort mode' question.I just bought the game, as it's been on my Wishlist for a while and now with a Rift it seemed like a good time to dive in.

I'm about half as tall as I should be and have to look up all the puzzles like the slightly awed child I am! :D I've been through the Steam VR seated setup a few times recalibrating it but it doesn't seem to change the height, regardless of whether I am sat or not.

2) Is there a way to turn off comfort mode via some ini flag?  I find the fact you turn in set increments quite disorientating.  

Either way great game so far, and I hope there's some plans afoot to allow a little more configuration of the VR experience even if never officialyl supported and\/or made available via ini tweaks.  I for one would love VR + mouse\/key controls.","Height problems in VR, 'comfort mode' question.I just bought the game, as it's been on my Wishlist for a while and now with a Rift it seemed like a good time to dive in.

The Witness,Puzzle,Marian,3,Problems with AMD Radeon HD 6990,en,-,"I just stared playing and this game is awesome!

There just seems to be a problem with my graphics card. It has a very loud fan and in this game, the fan doesn't turn on at all.
At lowest settings, I'm getting 20-30fps while standing and 15fps while moving.
In Rocket League, I'm getting 60fps throughout with highest settings. I don't own very graphically demanding games otherwise, so my hardware might not be up to it, but it still seems weird.

I made sure that all settings in the Catalyst Control Center are set to default (there aren't many though).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The Witness,Puzzle,TSDragoncar,4,Freezes when playing audio from different sources,en,-,"Whenever I play the Witness and play any sort of audio from an external source (for example, music or discord) my PC completely freezes.  This wasn't a problem when I played the Witness at launch.  The only thing I have changed since then is that I have started running my headphones through a USB amplifier. Could this be the problem or is something else causing this issue?

EDIT: I should have also said that this does not happen with any other game.

EDIT 2: I tried using speakers instead of my headphones so the problem is definitely something that has changed with the Witness or some drivers somewhere.

[b]EDIT 3: The game has started crashing within a minute of starting it even without any audio playing. is there any way to roll back to previous versions?	[\/b]

EDIT 4: I tried disabling SLI, clean installing graphics drivers with DDU, resinstalling the game.  Still freezing.

	[\/quote]",en,-,"Freezes when playing audio from different sourcesWhenever I play the Witness and play any sort of audio from an external source (for example, music or discord) my PC completely freezes.  This wasn't a problem when I played the Witness at launch.  The only thing I have changed since then is that I have started running my headphones through a USB amplifier. Could this be the problem or is something else causing this issue?

EDIT: I should have also said that this does not happen with any other game.

EDIT 2: I tried using speakers instead of my headphones so the problem is definitely something that has changed with the Witness or some drivers somewhere.

[b]EDIT 3: The game has started crashing within a minute of starting it even without any audio playing. is there any way to roll back to previous versions?	[\/b]

EDIT 4: I tried disabling SLI, clean installing graphics drivers with DDU, resinstalling the game.  Still freezing.

I did not see any post about this here, so I thought I report this.
After different time periods (today after 2m on high, then after ~15m; last week it was between 1-2h at max) I get the WHEA_uncorrectable_error BS. At first I read up on it and was not sure the game is responsible, but after going a week without playing this game,doing stuff like burn tests and playing other games without the BS coming up at all (I did play games that would stress my HW), my guess is that the problem is between the game and my PC.

","Bluescreen WHEA_uncorrectable_errorHi,
I did not see any post about this here, so I thought I report this.
After different time periods (today after 2m on high, then after ~15m; last week it was between 1-2h at max) I get the WHEA_uncorrectable_error BS. At first I read up on it and was not sure the game is responsible, but after going a week without playing this game,doing stuff like burn tests and playing other games without the BS coming up at all (I did play games that would stress my HW), my guess is that the problem is between the game and my PC.

The Witness,Puzzle,Toasty,11,Lower graphics below their current minimum levels?,en,-,"I've been playing this game for the past week and loving it, but I'm getting to the point where I can no longer ignore the huge dives in performance I experience around some areas of the game. Places like the town, the tetris marsh, and the temple with the cross-hatch puzzles slow down to near unplayable levels, sometimes threatening to crash. I'm playing with the lowest graphics settings, and supposedly I meet the minimum specs, but with the performance I'm getting, you'd think I was trying to run the game on an Easy Bake Oven.

I've noticed that the problem is especially bad around areas with water effects (like the waterfalls) and visually busy areas (the forests and thick grassy areas). My question, then, is if this is something that could be fixed by adding an extra garbage tier of graphics options to the launcher, or if there's some larger issue I'm not grasping. At this point, I'm willing to accept almost any hit in graphics to make the things run smoother. I just want to enjoy the rest of it without having to wait through five seconds of lag every time I want to move my character.

Any help is appreciated! And if the devs read this, thanks for the awesome game!

",en,-,"Lower graphics below their current minimum levels?I've been playing this game for the past week and loving it, but I'm getting to the point where I can no longer ignore the huge dives in performance I experience around some areas of the game. Places like the town, the tetris marsh, and the temple with the cross-hatch puzzles slow down to near unplayable levels, sometimes threatening to crash. I'm playing with the lowest graphics settings, and supposedly I meet the minimum specs, but with the performance I'm getting, you'd think I was trying to run the game on an Easy Bake Oven.

I've noticed that the problem is especially bad around areas with water effects (like the waterfalls) and visually busy areas (the forests and thick grassy areas). My question, then, is if this is something that could be fixed by adding an extra garbage tier of graphics options to the launcher, or if there's some larger issue I'm not grasping. At this point, I'm willing to accept almost any hit in graphics to make the things run smoother. I just want to enjoy the rest of it without having to wait through five seconds of lag every time I want to move my character.

Any help is appreciated! And if the devs read this, thanks for the awesome game!

The Witness,Puzzle,Fuzzball,1,What are the best settings to tweak in the launcher to improve performance?,en,-,"Just started playing this game today, and I'm doing my best to tweak the graphics to give good performance. My specs are a few years old and a laptop, but not terrible:

1920x1080 60Hz
Quad core i7-3630QM 2.4GHz
8GB RAM
GTX 675MX

When I start the game the launcher says Medium settings are recommended, which I then adjust to 1080p. I play in full screen with v-sync on, and turn ""multisampling"" off. Performance is mostly OK, but framerate drops down to 40-50fps and movement chugs in certain areas. These seem to be places with lots of foliage.

For example, when I run down the hill that's next to the opening fort\/courtyard, towards the path with blue panels on the left, green panels in a wooden hut on the right and pink trees in the distance.

When I change the settings in the launcher to Low, performance tends to remain constant 60fps, but I don't like how pixelated my character's shadow looks. Funnily enough, if I set the options to  ""Low"" but then change the individual Advanced Settings to ""Medium"", the shadows remain pixellated. But if I then turn up the main settings option to Medium, the shadows improve a bit, even though those Advanced Settings are all the same. So it seems there are some graphical settings going on in the background that change when you change main graphics settings, but can't be affected when you customise stuff in Advanced Settings.

Sorry for my late to the party ignorance. Can anyone suggest which Advanced Settings in the launcher to tweak that improve performance? I'm afraid I'm not very technically knowledgeable  and so am not really sure what each of these available options affects. But while I don't usually notice subtle differences, I will be able to able to see a big change (i.e. going from everything being Medium to everything being Low).

So yeah, what can I tweak? I'd rather not have to lower the resolution or go directly into the game's files if possible.

Thanks for helping me combat my ignorance.",en,-,"What are the best settings to tweak in the launcher to improve performance?Just started playing this game today, and I'm doing my best to tweak the graphics to give good performance. My specs are a few years old and a laptop, but not terrible:

The Witness,Puzzle,Bryguy,8,Crashing in same spot,en,-,"So I am computer stupid and I loved Braid and puzzle games so I wanted The Witness.  I use a macbook but I busted out my laptop I got from school about 4 years to play it.  It is a Toshiba Protege 13"" R830, pretty much stock exact I doubled the ram.  The game keeps crashing in the same spot, in the tutorial courtyard.  I can walk around 90% of the courtyard without concern but as soon as I try to go into one of the wall corner rooms for the puzzle, it crashes with the witness64_d3d11.exe stuff.  I have tried to do the alt + enter, the turning off vsync, running it in high quality mode, basically everything i can find and nothing works.

basically, i want to know if my computer can handle it, or if there is a bug in the game.  i bought this yesterday (4\/8\/16) and have been playing the stupid courtyard for an hour and a half to fix it.  nothing works.  should i just try to get my money back and retry a little later, or is there something else i should be doing. if it matters, when you first start the game and walk out of the tunnel into the courtyard, it is the room to the far left in front of you.  every other area and puzzle works, but just outside that room, it crashes.  

i want reiterate that i am computer stupid.  i wanted to play on my mac and it talked about a boot camp partition, but i don't know what any of that means.  i am not into games on my computer, mainly just xbox one so if it takes some technical know-how to fix, i am screwed.  i just want to play this puzzle game and move on with my life.  thanks for the help.",en,-,"Crashing in same spotSo I am computer stupid and I loved Braid and puzzle games so I wanted The Witness.

The Witness,Puzzle,Scratch17,5,Crashing / rebooting PC consistently in specific area,en,-,"Hey, guys.

I bought The Witness maybe two weeks ago, and I've been playing it on and off for a while now. Really loving it. But today I upgraded my graphics card from a nVidia GTX 570 to a GTX 970. I was then playing for a while, maybe 10 minutes, and then in the Treehouse area, learning about the coloured stars, my PC shuts down and then restarts. No blue screen, no crash to desktop, just a full-on reboot. I go back in, the game loads in the same area, I turn a corner heading to a puzzle and it restarts again.

At first I thought it was the card, overtemp, or the power supply. I have a 850W in my rig, so the power consumption shouldn't be an issue. I then run a bunch of other games and apps I had installed to test and see if they also crash, and I have a temperature monitoring app open on the other monitor.

FurMark: 1080P preset test, max GPU temp +- 65°C, 4000+ score. No crash.
Bioshock Infinite: Benchmark test and a few minutes of gameplay, 1080P ultra graphics DX11, max temp (CPU and GPU) +- 55°C. No crash.
Dishonored: Max graphics available from in-game menus, max temp (CPU and GPU) +- 50°C. No crash.
Portal Stories: Mel: Played about an hour, max graphics, 1080P, max temp (CPU and GPU) +- 50°C. No crash.

I found at least 2 posts about people suffering from crashes (albeit crash to desktop) happening at around the same area of the map, and the GTX 970 was mentioned too. Does anyone have any concrete information about this crash, or can give me hints on how to possibly diagnose the issue?

PC info:
GALAX nVidia GTX 970 (brand new)
Core i7 950
850W PSU
24GB RAM

TL:DR; I play The Witness for a less than an hour with my new GTX 970 and it causes PC to reboot when I'm in the Treehouse area, but not during other games. Any ideas?",en,-,"Crashing / rebooting PC consistently in specific areaHey, guys.

The Witness,Puzzle,MyuniHausen,0,microstutter again. borderless window mode the base cause?,en,-,"In my last post about microstutter, the majority of problems were solved by using an alternate vsync option for Nvidia cards, thanks to The Invisibl.

The Witness runs great now, except for 1 stutter every 60 seconds.
Digging deeper, I found out that losing v-sync might be connected to the game running in borderless window mode.
Checking with MGS5, I can confirm this. In borderless window mode v-sync is lost from time to time, resulting in stutter. Switching to exclusive fullscreen solves this issue completely, perfect v-sync, always.

So, my question is, are there plans introducing exclusive fullscreen to The Witness in the near future to address this issue? Would it be difficult, possible at all to do so?

original entry:

Great game, stunning visuals, but there are some problems with the rendering:
Every 5 - 20 seconds my frametimes have drops from 16ms to 33ms, causing annoying microstutter, regardless of quality settings. I am having this issue on a freshly installed Windows 7 (64bit) and Windows 10 (64bit), latest Video-Drivers.
Other games, like MGS5, run butterly smooth 60fps without any hitches.
On PS4, the Witness supposedly offers rock solid 60fps, so, what's the thing with the PC-Version?

According to [url=http:\/\/support.cyanworlds.com\/kb\/articles\/will-there-be-a-linux-version-of-obduction]Cyan Support[\/url], there is no Linux version planned. This does not mean there [i]won't[\/i] be one, but it's unlikely that there will be. The best bet to get it working on Linux is either to run a virtual machine (which means you're not using Linux directly; you're using Windows or Mac), or use an emulator. This discussion is about getting the Windows version of Obduction working on Linux using Wine (often stylized as WINE, but it's simpler to not use all-caps).

[h1]How can I use WINE\/Proton to make Obduction work?[\/h1]
[b]On August 21st 2018, Steam announced that in the Client Beta for Linux, you can install and run Windows games via Steam Play.[\/b] In order to do this, please follow these steps (I added the numbers to the quote):

[i]Update: Running Windows games via Steam Play now a default feature in the stable release.[\/i]

You can also make it work manually using [url=https:\/\/github.com\/Matoking\/protontricks]Protontricks[\/url]:

[quote=sorthious;1609400247629841012]The AppID [is] 306760, [but] if you have protontricks you can use: protontricks -s <game_name> to find an AppID.

When running the shell script you actually need to point to the Wine Bottle where the game is located, followed by the command to launch the script.  It's probably best to just unzip the folder into your Obduction folder under the ...steamapps\/compatdata folder.  Once that's done, change directory to that folder via terminal.  Then, type the following command to launch it:

[code]$ WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX=""\/home\/<username>\/.steam\/steam\/steamapps\/compatdata\/306760\/pfx"" .\/install-mf.sh[\/code]

After that you should be good to go.[\/quote]

[i]Protontricks requires the Steam Client Beta, Python 3.4 or newer, and Winetricks to be installed on your Linux system![\/i]

[h1]I just got an error in trying to make Obduction work. What does it mean?[\/h1]
These are the most likely errors you may get when trying to make Obduction work in Wine. I ran across these errors due to the fact that the hardware of my Ubuntu laptop is not sufficient enough to run Obduction, but just because you have the minimal requrements doesn't mean that you won't still run across them. These errors were produced using PlayOnLinux under pretty much any Wine version available. All other settings not mentioned are system default.
[list]
[*] Using GDI as the DirectDraw Renderer:
[code]DX11 feature level 10.0 is required to run this engine.[\/code]
This basically means that Obduction is using DirectX 10 features in DirectX 11. If your system supports DX10, you can attempt to run it, but you might want to be safe and make sure that your hardware will [i]at least[\/i] support DX11. [i][url=https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Feature_levels_in_Direct3D]Learn more about feature levels here.[\/url][\/i]
[*] Using GDI and appending an argument to use DirectX 10:
[code]DX11 feature level 10.0 is required to run this engine.[\/code]
You can force DirectX 10 by right-clicking on the game in your Steam library, click [i]Properties[\/i], then click [i]Set Launch Options...[\/i] and type ""-dx10"" or ""-d3d10"". However, DirectX 11 seems to still be required.
[*] Using DirectX 9, switching to Windows 7 or older, OR switching from GDI as the renderer (when not forcing OpenGL):
[code]The global shader cache file 'C:\/Program Files(x86)\/steam\/steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Engine\/GlobalShaderCache-PCD3D_SM4.bin' is missing. 

Your application is built to load COOKED content. No COOKED content was found; This usually means you did not cook content for this build. It also may indicate missing cooked data for a shader platform(e.g., OpenGL under Windows): Make sure your platform's packaging settings include this Target RHI. 

Alternatively build and run the UNCOOKED version instead.[\/code]
This usually means that the virtual hardware is not supported or out of date, but it can also mean that something is truly missing. Do a file verification check in the Steam client; if all the files are there, reinstall. If it still doesn't work, then there's either missing dependencies or your hardware is out of date.
[*] Forcing OpenGL with argument ""-opengl"", with GLSL support on and the renderer using OpenGL:
[code]The global shader cache file C:\/Program Files(x86)\/steam\/steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Engine\/GlobalShaderCache-GLSL_150.bin' is missing. 

Your application is built to load COOKED content. No COOKED content was found; This usually means you did not cook content for this build. It also may indicate missing cooked data for a shader platform(e.g., OpenGL under Windows): Make sure your platform's packaging settings include this Targeted RHI. 

Alternatively build and run the UNCOOKED version instead.[\/code]
The hardware is still unsupported, or dependancies are not met. I think OpenGL 4 is the minimum. This is a common error on Mac OS, as well.
[*] Using the ""-vulkan"" argument outputs ""[i]Fatal error![\/i]"". Vulkan may not be supported yet by your hardware.

[h1]What hardware is recommended to run Obduction in Wine?[\/h1]
I've edited this section to include what I think should be the minimum hardware requirements to run the game in Wine.
[list]
[*][b]OS Version – Windows 7 SP1 64 bit or newer.[\/b] Wine can fool a program into thinking it's any version of Windows, so this is easy to fulfill. Any Linux version can run Wine, but I recommend Ubuntu.

I know how the Villeins work, I know how to solve them and fill out the Villein squares. 
So when I originally reached where the pods are the villein was fine, I typed 222 in it and it brought me the mayor. 
But then I realised I might've missed the Sweet Caroline achievement so I loaded a save from when I had just reached the pod area, went to go type 194 in the system, and saw that I couldn't.

The number 217 (I think anyway) is PERMANENTLY typed out. [b]I can't erase it[\/b], and if I add to it, it brings me low number pods like 40 and 45 and I have no idea what to do??? And if I etch out what I added to it to bring me pods (lke 40 and 45) then it sends me back up to the top.

I tried loading an even EARLIER save, from when I had just finished Soria and was just starting to go through the left path of the maze, and still the number 217 is there.

Please help me, this game previously deleted my save like 2 years ago (I had just reached the Gauntlet when this happened) and I've finally managed to get back into it and finish it but this is just ♥♥♥♥ing me over at this point.


Edit: I saw a post where someone said that it just looks like it's there, so I went ahead and typed 194 over the top of the number that was there and it worked, I got the achievement. 

[b]BUT[\/b] 222 is still not working. I even made a point to go over all the lines on the villein and ""erase them"" (can't actually be erased because of the glitch) and then try inputting 222 numerous times and ways and it is not calling up the mayor.

I made a post about this a long time ago in the general discussion but I only just realized that there's a whole technical discussion forum, so I thought I'd post it here as it's really messing up my experience.

In both 2D and VR, something weird happens when I get close to an object. It will ""shimmer"" (it almost looks like the transporter from Star Trek) and then the model gets replaced with a more detailed version. An example of this are the small succulents in the starting area. From far away, they look a little more basic but when you get close they ""shimmer"" and a more detailed model with more branches appears. This also happens with shadows, rocks, buildings, pretty much everything in the game.

Now, every game has LOD and pop-in, so that's not an issue in itself. However, it's extremely distracting when teleporting in VR because all the detailed models load about one second after I teleport, so everything in the world shimmers and is replaced. For big buildings it is extremely immersion-breaking. (Also, it happens when an object is like 5 feet away, which seems closer in distance than most games have LOD changes).

This does not happen if I turn of motion controls and use the traditional ""Myst"" node movement - for some reason when I jump to another node everything is loaded fine. However, I really like using motion controls in this game.

 Also, I played about 4 hours of the game in the spring and it didn't do this, but then one day it suddenly did. I tried multiple reinstalls, settings changes, etc. and it didn't change anything. I put the game on hold until a new update was released but I tried it yesterday and it still happens.

TLDR Version: All the game's objects have a pop-in ""Shimmering"" that happens when I'm a couple feet from an object. It happens when teleporting with motion controls but doesn't happen if I ditch motion controls and go with the node-based movement. I've tried reinstalls, changing settings, etc. and nothing fixes it (and it doesn't seem to be tied to any in-game settings, even the draw distance setting). It didn't do this when I first started the game but now it has consistently done it ever since the issue first appeared.

Can anyone help me? I've loved this game so far but it's a big annoyance to have this shimmering happen all the time.

I have a GTX 1080 and HDR only engages if you enable it in windows first AND use Borderless Window.

True Fullscreen mode fixed these problems but then the game ""fails"" to send an HDR flag to my display [Sony ZD9\/Z9D] and HDR is disabled.

I find this very confusing because most PC games REQUIRE [exclusive] fullscreen to have HDR work properly.

TL;DR - Please could you just add an option for HDR that we can check in the options that also works with [exclusive] fullscreen mode?

TL;DR - Please could you just add an option for HDR that we can check in the options that also works with [exclusive] fullscreen mode? If this isn't possible [I'm guessing it is since other users here talk about an old build that had a toggle] then could you at least explain why?",-,https://steamcommunity.com/app/306760/discussions/1/1643170903494553845/,10/08/19 06:39,18/01/2024 12:09:24,Bug Report,1

Obduction,Puzzle,Nicholas Steel,0,Make text on documents clearer?,en,-,"Is there a way to make the font on documents\/books clearer? I saw an option regarding this in a configuration file but I haven't tested out what it does.

Edit: The configuration setting bEnhancedBookLegibility does vaguely make it easier to read the text by slightly zooming the documents but it causes the mouse courser to render behind the document and the collision box for changing pages doesn't change so its a bit of a guessing game on where to click to change pages. It also makes the pages appear in a perfect white rectangle so it no longer looks like looking at a document.

It'd be nice if there was simply a way to make it so the font appeared clea, crisp and well contrasted instead of like it was typed on an old type writer with a dry ink ribbon or with a light washing it out.

The game is excellent in both visuals and logic. But there seems to be a bug at near the end, and it's a weird one.

Before heading for the bleeder detonator, I unplugged the battery and just for the sake of it went to the water tank. Saw the lever and out of nowhere a ""what if"" question spawned in my head.

I turned the lever and it stopped water supply to the trees(!). The leaves turned red and after a few seconds reverted back to green although supply was off(!!). Then as soon as I turned back and started walking away from the tank the computer crashed and went into a hard reset(!!?).

Next time the game loaded from near the tank and water supply was on. I turned it off again and the same thing repeated - system hard reset. :-|

Ideally, the player should not be allowed to go near the tank at near ending and\/or turning the lever should have no effect once water is turned on. But the game seems to allow the player to do it (but clearly doesn't have the code for managing a situation where water is turned off after watering all four trees), leading to some kind of fatal exception I guess and resulting in system reset instead of just the program getting closed.

Hope some light is shed on this.
Thanks

black. Only when i manually switch to full screen mode, the menu is displayed

But its simply frustrating and should not happen with a game developed by a professional
company. Before i hear anything like: 'It must be your MacBook' - let me assure you
everything else runs perfectly fine on my MacBook, only Obduction does not.

3. In the game, sometimes i cannot move certain levers, especially
the one to rotate the bridge above the river. This is definitely a technical issue
and not because of a puzzle. I know the game state i am in (i solved almost all Myst games without resorting to a walkthrough), The lever MUST

Obduction,Puzzle,dap429,5,Bug in Kaptar portal (stuck in a game),en,-,"In Kaptar, after destroying a Mofang red laser, I walked to the bridge, rotatetd it such that it faces the protal, and crossed the bridge. When I was crossing the portal boundary, i got stuck in between. I can rotate, look in every direction, but cannot move, I cane see ""both worlds"" at the same time, both faded and overlapping.
Quiting the game and reloading did not help. It loaded into exactly same state.
I am suspecting that the game saved status in the wrong moment storing illegal value in the .sav file (simillar bug to the infamous maze bug). 

Does anybody know how it can be fixed? I really wouldn't like to start the game all over again...
If this bug has already been reported somewhere and the fix is known, I would appreciate sending me a link to it.

A general note: I find Obduction extremely buggy. Shaky cursor which sometimes changes mode or disappers with no apparent reason, and aligment bugs like the one mentioned before and the maze bug. I believe that the game could have used additional few months of testing before offcial release. 
None of the Myst\/Uru games had this level of problems. Very disappointing.

Obduction,Puzzle,Wolfram,7,Obduction [publicpreview] VR problems,en,-,"First, thanks a lot for working on improved VR support! A game like Obduction with such a wonderful world deserves to be fully experienced in a way that only VR allows!

My setup is VR: SteamVR (HTC Vive), CPU: Intel Core i7-4790K, GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti, RAM: 16 GB, OS: Windows 10 Pro.

1st problem: Trying to start the game in VR while already in VR and using the SteamVR dashboard offers two options, one for SteamVR, one for Oculus. The Oculus option crashes, the SteamVR option launches the game on the Desktop, not in VR. To get VR going, I had to quit VR and run the game from the Desktop shortcut, which was quite counter-intuitive.

2nd problem: Resolution automatically decreases, causing extreme blur, making the game almost unplayable. The resolution apparently jumps to minimum when text is displayed (during the intro) or when reading notes, maybe at other times as well. The change is not reflected in the menu's resolution slider! But when I change the slider just one step to the left or right and apply, then the resolution is fine again - until it changes again on its own!

3rd problem: Although I chose advanced\/free locomotion, I could only teleport. And I had to press and hold the thumb button to activate teleport, which is suboptimal. If there are options, I didn't find them, the menu only showed keyboard actions. Pressing the thumb button should be an option, because just touching instead of pressing it works much better for me. Of course, true touchpad locomotion based on the controller (not head orientation) would be best, so I hope that's possible (maybe I just overlooked the option?).

That said, the world itself looks incredibly beautiful and wonderous - while resolution isn't minimized automatically. I'm looking forward to my three issues getting fixed so I can finally enjoy this great game and VR experience!

Obduction,Puzzle,CoyoteTraveller,3,Windows Users: Dealing with COOKED content problems,en,-,"The global shader cache file 'C:\/Program Files(x86)\/steam\/steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Engine\/GlobalShaderCache-PCD3D_SM4.bin' is missing.

Your application is built to load COOKED content. No COOKED content was found; This usually means you did not cook content for this build. It also may indicate missing cooked data for a shader platform(e.g., OpenGL under Windows): Make sure your platform's packaging settings include this Target RHI.

Alternatively build and run the UNCOOKED version instead.

Fatal error!

-----------------------------------------------------------

As of 8\/27\/2016, this means your system DOES NOT SUPPORT DIRECTX 11.  Unreal Engine 4 detects which version your system supports, and tries to load version-specific shader files.  Those shader files are present for DX11 (probably in the .pak file) but not for DX10, so it has no way to load them. Same with OpenGL, if you try and shove command-line flags onto it: no shader files, no work.  Different error messages indicate different problems.

Maybe there will be a patch to add shader files; I hope so!  Maybe not.  Install the latest drivers for your graphics card, if it's remotely recent, but at this point DX11 has been out long enough that everyone should have drivers if they exist.  If you see this error, you should consider the game incompatible with your graphics card.  Sorry.  Wait for information from Cyan about whether they can add support for DX10, it's up to them.

Supposedly, you can run 'dxdiag' to see what DirectX version you have installed.  Mine says DX11!  But I think that it's lying.  Or rather, I have it installed, but my graphics card doesn't support it.  You probably have the same problem.

-----------------------------------------------------------

However, in the meantime, there is a workaround. You do not want this workaround unless you like running at 1.5 FPS or maybe much worse (and 10 seconds per frame before you turn down the graphics settings).  You won't get any sound, either.  Seriously, consider this game to be incompatible, I'm not kidding.  But since I did the same thing with WATCH_DOGS and it took me like two days of effort to get it working, I might as well save you the trouble and condense all the information in one place.  But remember, you're wasting your time.

If you're not very familiar and comfortable with hacking at the inner workings of your computer, stop now.  Not kidding.  It's not compatible yet.

Try start->run->type 'dxcpl'.  This is a DirectX debugging tool, and it lets you fake what version you have, either up or down.  If you have it, cool, you can skip the next step.  If you don't, no fun for you; you get to uninstall and install some junk.

To get dxcpl, you want the Windows SDK.  This link is for Windows 8 but apparently it works for Windows 7 as well. https:\/\/developer.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/downloads\/windows-8-sdk This is specifically Windows 7 and .Net framework 3.5: https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/details.aspx?id=3138 If those don't get you dxcpl, then I don't know what will.  I'm not kidding, it took like two days to find a copy, and it wasn't worth it.  Just don't try and download it from a third party site because that's how you get viruses, man.  You want it from an actual Microsoft sdk.

Okay, now that you have dxcpl installed.  Open it up.  Go to 'edit list', which tells it which files to manipulate.  Add C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\Obduction\ (or wherever Obduction is installed), it'll warn you that this will impact everything in that folder, and that's what you want.

Bottom of the window, Feature level limit: 11_0, 'force WARP' on.  That should be everything you need.  I also have debug layer force off, mute all messages, disable feature level upgrade on, no break settings.

Now run it.  Glorious 10 seconds per frame!  Your life is hell.  Wait a couple minutes to get to the title screen, hold down the mouse button on settings until it opens the window, go to graphics at a glacial pace, turn down the graphics settings all the way, hit apply...and welcome to 1.5 frames per second.  On my machine at least, I can't even make it windowed, and that's probably a feature of this terrible hack.  Was it worth it?  No.  Not really.  Also note the lack of sound.  Maybe you can go into steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Obduction_Soundtrack and guess at what you're supposed to play, but I don't recommend it.  I don't recommend any of this.  Why did you do it?  Why?  That's between you and God.

Don't do this.  It's a waste of time.

And remember that if Cyan releases a patch that enables DX10, go back into dxcpl and remove Obduction from the list, otherwise you're gonna have a bad time and not get any benefit from a better version.",en,-,"Windows Users: Dealing with COOKED content problemsThe global shader cache file 'C:\/Program Files(x86)\/steam\/steamapps\/common\/Obduction\/Engine\/GlobalShaderCache-PCD3D_SM4.bin' is missing.

Your application is built to load COOKED content. No COOKED content was found; This usually means you did not cook content for this build. It also may indicate missing cooked data for a shader platform(e.g., OpenGL under Windows): Make sure your platform's packaging settings include this Target RHI.

Alternatively build and run the UNCOOKED version instead.

Fatal error!

-----------------------------------------------------------

As of 8\/27\/2016, this means your system DOES NOT SUPPORT DIRECTX 11.  Unreal Engine 4 detects which version your system supports, and tries to load version-specific shader files.  Those shader files are present for DX11 (probably in the .pak file) but not for DX10, so it has no way to load them. Same with OpenGL, if you try and shove command-line flags onto it: no shader files, no work.  Different error messages indicate different problems.

Maybe there will be a patch to add shader files; I hope so!  Maybe not.  Install the latest drivers for your graphics card, if it's remotely recent, but at this point DX11 has been out long enough that everyone should have drivers if they exist.  If you see this error, you should consider the game incompatible with your graphics card.  Sorry.  Wait for information from Cyan about whether they can add support for DX10, it's up to them.

Supposedly, you can run 'dxdiag' to see what DirectX version you have installed.  Mine says DX11!  But I think that it's lying.  Or rather, I have it installed, but my graphics card doesn't support it.  You probably have the same problem.

-----------------------------------------------------------

However, in the meantime, there is a workaround. You do not want this workaround unless you like running at 1.5 FPS or maybe much worse (and 10 seconds per frame before you turn down the graphics settings).  You won't get any sound, either.  Seriously, consider this game to be incompatible, I'm not kidding.  But since I did the same thing with WATCH_DOGS and it took me like two days of effort to get it working, I might as well save you the trouble and condense all the information in one place.  But remember, you're wasting your time.

If you're not very familiar and comfortable with hacking at the inner workings of your computer, stop now.  Not kidding.  It's not compatible yet.

I encountered some weird things in the game. As a result, I can't get any further. Here are the problems:

http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LhUB8

1. The teleportation device in picture 1 is missing since I fell though the world after activating the teleportation device for the first time. Reloading didn't do the trick, it's gone. 

2. I made it to that green tunnel, where you find that long number for the russian device and which leads to the turning wheel, which blocks the way to the tree. I walked back to the big machine and released the arm powering the wheel. Then I teleported back to Hunrath and wanted to use the teleportation device on the wooden platform to get back to that green tunnel. But the platform disappeared - there's the stone orb again. (see the pictures 2 and 3)

So, I can't reach the forest world through the teleporting device (which is missing) and can't reach the green tunnel, because the wooden platform can't be moved anymore. 

Does anyone have an idea how to solve this? Or do I have to start the game from the beginning again?

Note: Zero spoilers, just some ire and a little disappointment.

Let's start our complaints with the fact that the shaders are terribly structured and optimized, causing extremely slow processing in general - it's pretty, but let's tone it down a bit, yeah? Maybe ease back off the reference implementation of the blur shader that apparently also considers iris shape for some reason? Back down on the processing just a little bit, drop a few places of precision with the trivial things you know they won't notice, or at least do it in a sane order and number of batches per buffer.

Then, there's the model depth dispatches on LOD change being so inefficient that the game stutters and stumbles any time there's a change in complexity, relative directly to the complexity of said change. Yeah I know, I don't have the latest hardware blah blah here's the thing; my hardware should be able to run my settings. I know that because other games - one of which looks OUTSTANDING by the way - run much better with similar visual compromises - note, not similar settings, because ""Medium"" is subjective not objective and thus is an invalid comparison note, I speak of adjusting it to a similar subjective visual level of detail. In any case: That, too, really makes this almost impossible to enjoy.

Add to it the fact that the game doesn't apply its graphics settings properly when started. Like, WHAT!? How in the world could such a thing even be a thing? I thought I was nuts too, but here's the thing. I started the game, the first time, and spent a while messing with settings to make it run almost alright..quit, came back to it, and it ran terribly, and I thought ""WOW, did I just get USED to this?""  After poking ONE thing in the video settings menu - notably, Resolution Scale (it was some over-long LINE OF WORDS instead of ""100"")  life was again grand. I also sometimes had this happen with my video resolution - it was set to 1920x1080, or at least that's where I had put it - it would sometimes read 400x300 or some stupid value like that. It was always the same, as if the select box had no ""invalid"" default set, again. ... Wait, that's twice now...

Let's stop here for a sec. Seriously? EVERY TIME I changed this (Resolution Scale) then close Settings, go back to the game, go back to Setings, and it's a LINE OF WORDS again. Something like ""Invalid number"" or such, I'd imagine, because whoever designed the UI also didn't deign to assign a font size other than ""stretch to fill"" so the UI elements CHANGE SIZE ALL OF THE TIME, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? You can't write a function that sanitizes input and restores a default value if the one you're coming up with from preferences is invalid? (Are you sanitizing ANY of the user input? You're not, are you!?) You can't write a function that properly SAVES a setting? You can't write a function that properly LOADS a setting? Obviously the first one is true or I wouldn't see an error message crammed into a numeric field. Obviously one of the other two seems to be as well, if it saved AND loaded properly the number wouldn't have been invalidated to begin with. Then there's the fact that it happened with my Resolution as well, as I mentioned earlier.

ANYWAYS. So. After dealing with the settings stupidity, it ran smoothly once more - mostly, of course, everyone knows this doesn't run ""smoothly"" on most systems.

Then I restarted it again, and it was terrible again. Restarted the computer, then the game, fixed the settings, restarted the computer AND the game again - just to be thorough - and hey it worked. Nope, just kidding - it still forgot all of my settings. Clean install, clean driver install, I tried this a few dozen times. I eventually went offline on Friends because someone complained that I'd been starting and logging on too much. Seriously, I tested this every way I could to prove that it's not just some odd glitch of my system.

So, then I did something REALLY easy to spot. I changed the RESOLUTION, down to 1280x720. (Game runs only slightly better at this res, by the way.)  Now when I start the game, though, it's in 1920x1080 (according to Windows, my monitor, and my GPU) until I go to Settings, where it already says 1280x720, change it to anything, then change it back, and hit Apply. Then, it's CLEARLY 720p, and all of my other settings apply as well.


But wait, this was about it accessing my network shares, remember? Yeah, after all of this, I tried to enter the game and it would hang on the load screen. I have a NAS, with a faulty drive that fails to spin up sometimes, with a drive letter mapped in My Computer. (Replacement is on the way, don't you worry.)  Well, when it doesn't spin up, any attempt to access the drive hangs in IO Wait on the thread, I can hear the drive stumble a few times then spin up, click click whir, and then IO Wait clears and everything is fine. Guess what game just did exactly that? You guessed it, Obduction. So I waited for the thing to spin down again. Then re-launched Obduction, re-loaded my save, same hang until the thing spun up again. So then I unplugged the ethernet cable, and tried again - and Obduction STAYED HUNG until I forced Windows to remove the mapping, at which point my save loaded nearly instantly.

So, aside from apparently ""Where can I submit an application?"" I suppose my question stands:


Why in the wide broad world is Obduction reading from my network shares?

You're not, are you!?) You can't write a function that properly SAVES a setting? You can't write a function that properly LOADS a setting? Obviously the first one is true or I wouldn't see an error message crammed into a numeric field. Obviously one of the other two seems to be as well, if it saved AND loaded properly the number wouldn't have been invalidated to begin with. Then there's the fact that it happened with my Resolution as well, as I mentioned earlier.

ANYWAYS. So. After dealing with the settings stupidity, it ran smoothly once more - mostly, of course, everyone knows this doesn't run ""smoothly"" on most systems.

Then I restarted it again, and it was terrible again. Restarted the computer, then the game, fixed the settings, restarted the computer AND the game again - just to be thorough - and hey it worked. Nope, just kidding - it still forgot all of my settings. Clean install, clean driver install, I tried this a few dozen times. I eventually went offline on Friends because someone complained that I'd been starting and logging on too much. Seriously, I tested this every way I could to prove that it's not just some odd glitch of my system.

So, then I did something REALLY easy to spot. I changed the RESOLUTION, down to 1280x720. (Game runs only slightly better at this res, by the way.)  Now when I start the game, though, it's in 1920x1080 (according to Windows, my monitor, and my GPU) until I go to Settings, where it already says 1280x720, change it to anything, then change it back, and hit Apply. Then, it's CLEARLY 720p, and all of my other settings apply as well.


But wait, this was about it accessing my network shares, remember? Yeah, after all of this, I tried to enter the game and it would hang on the load screen. I have a NAS, with a faulty drive that fails to spin up sometimes, with a drive letter mapped in My Computer. (Replacement is on the way, don't you worry.)  Well, when it doesn't spin up, any attempt to access the drive hangs in IO Wait on the thread, I can hear the drive stumble a few times then spin up, click click whir, and then IO Wait clears and everything is fine. Guess what game just did exactly that? You guessed it, Obduction. So I waited for the thing to spin down again. Then re-launched Obduction, re-loaded my save, same hang until the thing spun up again. So then I unplugged the ethernet cable, and tried again - and Obduction STAYED HUNG until I forced Windows to remove the mapping, at which point my save loaded nearly instantly.

So, aside from apparently ""Where can I submit an application?"" I suppose my question stands:


Why in the wide broad world is Obduction reading from my network shares?

Anyway, I was in the area of Kaptar with the massive crank shaft. After getting it started, I tried going back the main ambassador seed used to get there. On the way there, if you don't use the elevator, you have to round a ninety-degree corner down some stairs. Since they hadn't been in view before the turn, and my graphics settings are at minimum, the entire section of staircase around the bend hadn't loaded yet. It loaded quickly, but it did so in such an order that I managed to start falling through the staircase before it was fully loaded.

No amount of moving or quitting was able to remove me from the stairs, so I had to take an hour and a half to redo all the progress I had made in the past week (puzzle games take a lot longer the first time through). 

Early on in this recovery playthrough, when I went through the membrane on Hunrath, the game stuttered at the exact time I was going to pass through. I ended up just outside Hunrath, embedded in the marbled purple terrain. Luckily, you aren't supposed to be out there, so there were no collisions to keep me stuck there.

Stray,Puzzle,Spooky_skellington,1,Dead End sequence too difficult for PC users,en,-,"Dear developers!
I love the game so far. I bought it today and haven't stopped playing. However I just got to the dead end sequence where you have to have a rapid pace to get past the critters? the bug thingys that squeal. I find it extremely difficult because  I got used to being able to steer the main character with my mouse. Now I as soon as I slide down, I have to use WASD. which in itself isin't the biggest issue. this stage is difficult because not only do you have to redirect from mouse aim to WASD but you also have to press in shift along with left alt to get through. Some of you guys might be great with hand coordination, But I can't hold down all of those buttons at the same time and make it through. I saw another post on here, describing their inability to to the same due to disability and I am only writing this in the hopes of making the game as inclusive and fun for everyone. I am aware that it is not an easy fix but for the development of the game I reckon it would be beneficial.

Stray,Puzzle,JpTiger0,0,Slums Part 2 Progress  Bug,en,-,"A few people seem to have experienced part of this: when you start Slums part 2, all of your inventory is empty, the game seems to have no memory of your meeting any of the robots (prompt is always ""meet""), the safe is closed even if you've opened it, the musician has no music, baterman has all his items back, the vending machines that had drinks are full, the paint hasn't been spilled outside the laundromat and generally it acts as if you were never there.

Here's the really weird part though: if you go back to where you entered the slums for the very first time, the cat will slow to a walk and then you'll get the ""THE SLUMS"" overlay over the screen as if you are entering the area for the very first time.

I am past the window of return for Steam, and the only reason I haven't filed a chargeback with my bank is because I do not want my Steam account banned. 

Here's the thing: I cannot play this game without getting EXTREMELY nauseous. This is due to the restrictive FOV. By not adding an option to adjust the settings, I am unable to play the game without severe discomfort. It's 2022, and FOV adjustment is built in to UE4. So why not add it to the settings screen?? Not only that, y'all have added forced TAA and depth of field, making even an hour of gameplay is horrendously dysphoric. 

I've been playing a lot of Spiderman Remastered lately, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s one of those games that makes you wish EVERY studio took accessability seriously. The freedom to set my FOV, turn off motion blur, disable depth of field, use DLSS, DLAA, or any kind of anti-aliasing I want -- it's almost as if the people who ported the game gave a ♥♥♥♥ about being as inclusive as possible when it comes to gamers' varying degrees of cognitive, visual, or audible shortcomings and strengths.

Possible solution: Introducing a FPS cap while the game is NOT in focus will fix this issue.",-,https://steamcommunity.com/app/1332010/discussions/1/3467226415500725665/,24/07/22 07:54,18/01/2024 12:21:27,Bug Report,4
