"Hello Neighbor","Horror","Hello Neighbor crash when loading the game","en","-","DAYVUUN","5","Think I found the fix to this... Before you boot this game up, ensure that you have the Epic Games Launcher downloaded and updated.  Find Hello Neighbor in your steam library, right click and hit properties, hit local files, then browse. Look for the Engine folder, then find the Extras folder, next go into the Redist folder, then the en-us folder. You will see something called UE4PrereqSetup_x64, double click it and ensure that you also have this downloaded before opening up the game. \n\nAfter ensuring that you have all of that done, type env into your windows search bar and find ~Edit the system environment variables~. Make sure you are in the Advanced tab and at the bottom right you will see Environment Variables, click it. NOW MAKE SURE YOU ARE UNDER System variables and hit New... \n\nFor the Variable name: OPENSSL_ia32cap\nFor the Variable value: ~0x20000000\n\nHit Save and this should fix the problem. If it still isn't working, try running the game at a lower frame rate. Had another game that was crashing on me and this fixed the game as well.

I collected all the tapes (6 with the crow sticker and 2 without). I inserted the red cassette into the tape recorder, listened to it. Then I walked around the location. When I returned, the red cassette was not in the tape recorder, but it can be played: that is, its model is not there, it cannot be pulled out, another one cannot be inserted, interacting with the area with the cassette in the tape recorder opens\/closes the tape recorder lid. What to do? Restart doesn't help. In the slot where I found the cassette, it's not there either.
Also, I couldn't find the red ""rec"" button on the tape recorder.

Помогите!!!

When I move the camera around with a controller it camera just goes diagonal, no matter how hard I try to get the camera to move correctly it just won't. \n\nAnd that's all.","en","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/1321680/discussions/1/5143704785450675350/","19/12/22 20:38","18/01/2024 04:43:12","Bug Report"

Tried to change this in the settings (For this I still needed to use my mouse as any buttons still don't work for getting into a submenu) I have it now on 0% sensitivity but it still has the same speed and feels unplayable to me.\n\nEDIT: Had to put sensitivity on 0%\/20%\/20% aka all on the lowest possible to make it work.
