We were able to reproduce the issue on one of our machines and have tracked the problem down to the igfxEM.exe process, which is part of [b]Intel's graphics driver[\/b] suite.

The igfxEM.exe process permanently holds handles to [i]all[\/i] folders inside Steam's game library folder. It prevents games from writing or deleting files and folders inside the game's installation directory. In our case it prevents us from saving and loading the game. We are investigating all possible workarounds, but at the moment it looks like there won't be an easy fix for this issue. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Please note that only certain systems with certain divers are affected by this issue. We do not have a complete list of affected systems and driver versions, but we believe it is related to Intel HD 530 graphics. We have contacted Intel's support and provided detailed information about the issue, but have not heard back from them yet.


If you see the following message in Subnautica, it might be due to igfxEM.exe:

Nvidia GTX 1650 Super
AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4Ghz
16gb DDR4
Windows 10 (not activated, but like does that really matter)

If anyone knows how to read the playerlog at the bottom to potentially help me understand my issue further, please lmk.

Please ask for further clarification on ANY part of this but here goes. 
Tried to get into this game 2 years ago, got many hours into my first playthrough (explored the aurora, built prawn, yet to venture below 500m so not huge progress but enough). As soon as I loaded the NW mushroom forest it felt like my game started to crash regularly. it did not frequently make crash reports when that would happen, OCCASIONALLY my entire pc would crash during gameplay. Basically I'm a forgetful enough person when it comes to saving that I quit playing for 2 years.
This week my partner and I caved and really wanted to play, started a new save file and he's been taking it nice and slow. NO issues so far until today. was running around the safe shallows, kelp forests, and grassy plateus getting resources and adding to the base. not venturing out super far, never loaded the mushroom forest on this save file. I left to get a drink and was sitting perfectly still in my seabase, hadn't loaded a new area in a bit, when I got back I unpaused and my game just crashed in front of my eyes with no error message or anything. lost an hour or 2 of progress. 
When I opened the game immediately after, I loaded my hours old save and moved around  in my seabase for 5 minutes max, and my ENTIRE PC CRASHED, no blue screen, just as if someone cut the power.

I have verified the integrity of steam files. I did have discord open when the crash happened, I'm certain I would be smart enough to keep chrome closed, the memory hog. If i play again in the next couple days I'll probably have ONLY Subnautica and NZXT open so I can monitor what's going on. I will say though, I feel like when I had this issue 2 years ago, I definitely tried to play with ONLY subnautica open and it just kept happening

HERE IS MY PLAYER LOG FROM TODAY: https:\/\/pastebin.com\/vYQgxFJ2

Clicking outside of the main rectangle area of the PDA, with either left or right button, results in the cursor jumping back into the dead center of the screen.
Pressing Esc brings up the global menu that lets you exit the game.

Amusingly, this did not harm the achievements. After ""Unstucking"" myself and launching the rocket, I got both the time capsule achievement and the game end achievement.

Obviously, we have to play the legacy version in order for Nitrox to work. Anyway, I built a scan room temporarily during the construction of the base. I have been adding and removing base pieces during the design process (I'm pretty meticulous and even borderline obsessive about getting everything just right!)
At one of my play sessions, I opened the game and noticed the scan room was turned 90 degrees from how I had originally positioned it.

"Subnautica","Survival","Iron Bacon","0","Several major bugs and a couple of minor ones","en","-","Found some new major bugs since the latest update, as well as a couple of minor ones.

1. Dialogue\/audio stepping on itself: If two lines of dialogue need to happen at the same time, it used to be that it would finish playing whichever one started first, and then play the second one. Now it frequently plays both at the same time, so I get two people talking at once making it hard to understand what either one is saying. The same thing happens with audio cues (sound effects that occur in response to certain events), causing a weird cacophany. Sometimes dialogue or audio cues will completely cut each other off before they're finished.
2. Animation glitch: During the sunbeam event, after the gun fired, instead of rotating back into its upright position, it just instantly reset back to it. The animation for the return to position simply didn't play for whatever reason.
3. Marblemelon cutting: Someone said that this is likely due to the knife range being shortened, but it's very finicky trying to cut marblemelons for seeds now. You have to find just the right angle or else you physically can't hit them, because the knife doesn't reach and there's no crouch mechanic. I consider this a major bug, because something as simple as swinging your knife at an object that's right in front of you should be functionally simple and straightforward.

MINOR BUGS:
1. When entering the moonpool via ladder, it shows the entire room as being blue as if your character is still underwater. This only clears after the entire ladder animation has completed (as opposed to when you break the surface of the water).
2. Screen shaking when PDA is opened: Quite often when the PDA is opened the screen shakes like your character is trembling.","en","-","Several major bugs and a couple of minor onesFound some new major bugs since the latest update, as well as a couple of minor ones.

"Subnautica","Survival","Nicholas","10","Controllers have been incorrectly mapped on Mac for years (fix inside)","en","-","Subnautica developers,

This is an issue that has been repeatedly reported in this support forum and elsewhere since 2017 (examples [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/264710\/discussions\/3\/1700541698686225988\/]here[\/url], [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/264710\/discussions\/3\/1693785669848603078\/]here[\/url], [url=https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/264710\/discussions\/3\/1471967615871204936\/]here[\/url], [url=https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/subnautica\/comments\/6txfrm\/pls_help_xbox_360_controller\/]here[\/url]), and has still not been fixed as of the Big Little Update.

[b]Problem[\/b]

My controller behaves like so:

- Right-stick Y-axis (up\/down) produces an input of the right-stick X-axis (right\/left).
- Right-stick X-axis produces an input of the triggers (left -> LT, right -> RT).
- Many other button mappings are incorrect: for example, pressing RT on the controller inputs right on the D-pad.

I personally tested this with a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller (as supported in Steam), but from extensive searching, the symptoms match bug reports from other Mac users using Xbox or Xinput gamepads.

As reported by others, this issue occurs for me only in Subnautica and cannot be reproduced with the same controller configuration anywhere else in my Steam library.

Unplugging all other USB devices and removing any interfering inputs (e.g. from external mice) does not fix the problem, nor does a full reinstallation.

[b]Diagnosis[\/b]

I decided to test and research this issue myself in the hopes that it will accelerate a much-needed fix, both in the current Unity 2018.2 branch and the forthcoming Unity 2019 update.

I have determined that [b]this behaviour is specific to macOS[\/b] and the cause of the problem is that [b]Subnautica is configured to use Unity's Windows controller map on all platforms[\/b]. However, Unity's input manager uses different numerical axis\/button mappings for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Subnautica does not account for this in the Mac build (and possibly also not in the Linux build).

This matches the erroneous behaviour exactly. [url=https:\/\/wiki.unity3d.com\/index.php\/Xbox360Controller]According to this page[\/url] (scroll down to the table under ""Bindings""), controller axis numbers for Windows (for the drivers described) are as follows:

- 3 = Triggers
- 4 = R-stick X
- 5 = R-stick Y
- 6 = D-pad X

While controller axis numbers for Mac are as follows:

- 3 = R-stick X
- 4 = R-stick Y
- 5 = LT
- 6 = RT

Also refer to the tables in the comments [url=https:\/\/answers.unity.com\/questions\/1350081\/xbox-one-controller-mapping-solved.html]here[\/url] (again, for the Xbox 360 driver).

In sum, controller support in the Mac build is improperly configured to use Windows-specific axis\/button numbers in Unity's input manager.

Please fix this urgently. The Mac version has been unplayable with controllers for a long while, and I believe I have identified the issue.","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/3/1658943116242610940/","24/11/19 18:59","18/01/2024 10:18:05","Bug Report"

I've gathered a lot of supplies to start making my base. My only issues are I can't get the blueprints to the Floating island because everytime i get there, nothing is rendered.

Anyway... today i launched the Game... and my precious Savefile was nonexistent.
As i said, my last time playing was a few Years ago (2020) and i switched to a new PC a while ago.
Does someone has an Explanation where my Savefile is? Was there an Update\/Patch in the last few Years that could have caused that? Is this a Steam-cloud Error or do i somehow left my Savefile on my last PC?
It will take some time to rebuild everything and witness the late-game wholesome moments again (seeing the little ones growing up for example). *sigh* i build a Sample-Database near my Rocket to catalog all plants, animals and Ressources.... it took so long to build all of this x.x

Help or atleast an Explanation would be really appreciated.
While waiting for a Response from the helpful Elite-Subnautica Players in this Forum or the Dev..... *sigh* looks like i have to do a new Savefile.

Tested: I built a scanner room in the mushroon forest, to scan for fragments. I made sure to position the scanner room only about 101 m from the two fragments I had found by accident. These fragments were only a few meters from each other. Whatever I did, I could not get the scan list of the scanner room to show the ""Fragment"" option.

First issue is that creatures tend to go through the floor. For example, I've encountered a lava lizard in clipping through the floor of the antechamber. 

Model lighting is also messed up. The PDA will glow pink, because the game still treats it as the active lava zone. Even after going through the teleporter to the crag field cache and entered the biome fully, the character model was still glowing as though it were in the lava zone.

The Prawn Suit tends to get half-stuck in the floor, causing it to only slide around on the floor slowly. Using the jet jump won't get you even a millimeter off the ground when that happens. Even when using the grappling hook, it rarely gets you unstuck. The only temporary fix is going back into the aquarium somehow. No, I did not manage to get my Prawn Suit out of the floor. Yes, I saved after entering the facility with the Prawn Suit.

The aquarium has several issues. A lot of the time, mostly when getting close to walls, the game will think you're in the active lava zone instead of the aquarium. This usually comes with the entire structure of the aquarium disappearing. I don't even know what triggers it to re-appear (swimming back and forth to- and away from the wall over and over seems to do it), but even when it eventually does, the lighting is completely changed to a black\/green-ish tone. 


In conclusion: The Primary Research Facility is an utter glitchfest right now and I couldn't complete the game.","en","-","[Possible Spoilers] The Primary Containment Facility is all kinds of broken right now...Once I got to that point in the game, it became pretty much unplayably buggy.

  Here's what i've seen below:

1. Rendering issue
Ground texture does not appear when moving to another place. this vacant 'texture' is not just invisible but also has no object segment. Eventually my prawn suit traveled depth 4000m and crashed by pressure xd

2. Background music and sound effect repeats
Yes it is. But it happens while the game is running without problem.(And soon game crashes)

3. Save issue
I pressed save button, game stopped, not even shift+tap, alt+ctrl+del, works, 10 minutes later game works again, but soon crashes!

4. Cyclops teleport issue
I was in my cyclops and ate a melon, but suddenly teleported to outside of the submarine.

5. Module pole issue
Construction module has pole when it placed near ground, but my module has pole without near ground! And yes. it has object effect.

But yeas the prawn can be a pain to use when it does that.

2. the prawn can make you spawn out of the map.
exit it and byebye world. and yea I know if you stand next to a wall it does spawn sometime out of bounds. but no this bug is 10 time worst. you telepor out of the map in a black space and die from fall damage or the game crash.

3. out of bounds. you exit the prawn or any base, door, cyclop, you know the story...
and you or out of bounds.

4. flying to space. rare but possible. I have no idea of what happen but enter the prawn and space... yeas I can't find a way to do it again. :(

9. super infine grappling arm. the grappling arm will never let go! never! try to reload your game or delete it because it won't give up. :( random.

stop- falling. jetpack doesn't work. well it work but the prawn suit just don't go up. it stand on the ground and it affect the grappling arm to. the grappling arm will drag you but you won't go up. the only thing the praawn will do is going down faster and faster and faster until it stand here unable to move.

8. the prawn like to blow up. random. try to get your prawn to blow up and save your game at the same time. when you load your game again it have a chance to be in one piece. but yeas it will explode when you try to use it. bonus it can make other prawn blow up. the game is confuse and just blow up prawn... XD

9. super infine grappling arm. the grappling arm will never let go! never! try to reload your game or delete it because it won't give up. :( random.

10.upgrade doesn't work. random. you can fix it by simply removing the upgrade and placing it again.

1 этаж - вход в виде приваренного коридора,
лестница с первого этажа на второй, назовём её лестницей А.
2 этаж - верхнее отверстие лестницы А, и лестница Б : с второго этажа на третий.
3 этаж - верхнее отверстие лестницы Б.

Сама ситуация: зашёл в башню на 1-ом этаже, построил лестницу А, забрался по ней на 2-ой этаж, НАЧАЛ строить лестницу Б, буквально на один процент. А потом спустился   
1-ый этаж и разобрал лестницу А.
И ТУТ ВСЕ СЛОМАЛОСЬ.

Баг при строительстве, как исправлять?Расширял я, значит, базу... Решил пристроить башню из многофункциональных (круглых) комнат. Схема такая - в башне 3 этажа: 

1 этаж - вход в виде приваренного коридора,
лестница с первого этажа на второй, назовём её лестницей А.
2 этаж - верхнее отверстие лестницы А, и лестница Б : с второго этажа на третий.
3 этаж - верхнее отверстие лестницы Б.

Сама ситуация: зашёл в башню на 1-ом этаже, построил лестницу А, забрался по ней на 2-ой этаж, НАЧАЛ строить лестницу Б, буквально на один процент. А потом спустился   
1-ый этаж и разобрал лестницу А.
И ТУТ ВСЕ СЛОМАЛОСЬ.

"Subnautica","Survival","Wisp","13","Extensive list of glitches, bugs and annoyances on 1.0","en","-","I posted this on Reddit and on Official forums, and will paste here for more visibility. I won't keep this version updated, only [url=https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/subnautica\/comments\/7wool5\/extensive_list_of_glitches_bugs_and_annoyances_on\/]Reddit[\/url] (Official forums allow only 24h edits)

I will try to keep it simple. [b]Number 1 and 2 are highest priority fixes please[\/b]. Number 11 and even more 32 could possibly help a lot with performance (limit how far bases are seen\/calculated)

1. Texture Quality locked at ""4"" (highest), causing stutter and eventual break down of the engine with time on anything but ultimate PC-specs. (extra: no Texture Quality slider on options, you have to reduce manually every time you start on F3)

2. Falling through the ground, specially with the PRAWN. Multiple causes but the above can help compound to the problem (collision detection is known to fail on low FPS\/stutter events). Include here multiple clip issues like getting stuck inside walls and such.

3. You cannot access the PRAWN upgrades nor storage while docked at the Moonpool

4. No hitbox on PRAWN (and Seamoth? don't remember) while docked at the Moonpool, so if you get too close\/move over it, you fall

5. Creatures also clipping through terrain and often getting stuck under the floor (happens a lot with reaper leviathans), at which case they are often despawned.

6. Some visual elements like smoke and green\/blue acid pools in the Lost River render in front of the Cyclops bridge overlay, totally hiding them.

7. Neptune Plataform requires ""deep water"" to be built ... except it is a barge, not a sub.

8. The whole energy transmission issue, where on load they can break chain.

9. Creatures (and cameras!) can move across the water\/air shields on caves, meaning you can be hunted down by hostile creatures into it, or fly with cameras inside.

10. Creating more than one scanner room at a time can cause cameras to have the same number\/name, complicating choosing which to control. 

11. Base energy warning is shown no matter how far you are, meaning a random base that have the energy toggling on\/off will keep displaying such message to you forever, causing delay on real time messages. Fix: do not show those messages unless you are close to base.

12. Single fishes enter and get stuck at bases (fix: do not allow them to swim too close to bases). Sometimes even aggressive creatures get inside.

13. School of fishes move inside bases (fix: do not spawn them close to bases)

14. Fishes inside Alien Containment sometimes will also clip out and swim inside your base

15. When you are grabbed by a reaper and thrown away, you can easily clip the ground\/walls. It can also happen when you are pushed by Ghost leviathans. 

16. Large bases (not even that large) get annoyingly slow to build with sometimes requiring up to 10 seconds of the game hanging when you add\/remove a module (calculating integrity? seems too much for that)

17. Render distance could be increased on high-end PCs (currently you can tweak clipmaps-high.json to get some more)

18. We need an auto-save, even if the proposed ""when entering\/leaving a base or cyclops"" because the crashes are causing people to loose hours of gameplay. (extra: improve saving algorithm, takes too long. 100mb savefile? Minecraft autosaves each 10 seconds and can have maps nearly 1Gb)

19. Last 2 achievements not working

20. Deconstructing a moonpool while you are standing on it (possible if you enter it while it is still not fully constructed) causes you to fall with normal gravity to your death

21. Rotating items (like the aurora model) advances to the next item on hotlist, making rotating such items a shore

22. Beacons on dry land have weird glitches, like eventually sliding under the ground

23. If you try to access a locker from a distance, sometimes the PDA won't display

24. If you build your base close to an area where Stalkers play with wreckage, with time there will be literally dozens of stalker tooth on the ocean floor lagging the game (My 28h game, I had to make 3 trips to clean up all the tooth and throw them in the trash)

25. Lifepod icon will stay stuck onscreen (won't move) if you load a save where you hid such icon in the PDA

26. Multiple reports of the giant Tree Cove Tree not showing (happened to me once, I was able to move thru where it should be with my Cyclops with no issues). Reloading fixed it.

27. Cyclops is not flooding

28. Vines clip through everything

29. Teleport\/warp console commands don't work if you are inside a vehicle and often lead you to get stuck.

30. Sometimes the Sunbeam doesn't appear during the descent cutscene.

31. Posters put on a glass window cannot be removed, nor the window.

32. Bases are always visible\/calculated no matter the distance. Other than a visual nuisance (you can see the lights across any distance), it bogs down FPS even when you are far. Same happens with the Cyclops and even sunk Cyclops.

33. Alien Containment hatches are counted towards your base integrity

"Subnautica","Survival","DeRusGAMING","1","Subnautica Save Bug: Freezing and Crashing with RAM Drain","en","-","Hey everyone, I've been playing Subnautica for about 15 hours now and I'm loving it, but I've been running into a frustrating issue. When I try to save my game, it freezes and starts eating up my RAM. Eventually, my computer crashes and I have to start over from my last save. I thought it might be related to how far I had traveled in the game, but now it seems completely random. Also, it might be helpful to note that I can often tell when this bug is present before I save because of the lack of props and mobs spawning. This includes fragments, small plants, and even kelps.

Issue: I've been searching online and haven't been able to find anyone else having this problem, which makes me wonder if it's something specific to my computer. My hardware configuration includes an AMD Ryzen 5600H processor, 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD with 80GB of free space, and an Nvidia RTX3060 mobile graphics card. It's really starting to get on my nerves because it's preventing me from making any real progress in the game.

Investigation: I've tried everything I can think of to fix this issue. I've reinstalled the game, uninstalled any recently installed programs, turned off my antivirus, lowered the game details, and deleted the Cells cache. I even checked the troubleshooting guide, but nothing seems to work.

Possible Solutions: At this point, I'm not sure what else to do. I hope I'll be able to find a solution soon. Is there anyone who could help me resolve this? I am desprate. I can't even refund the game now! :(","en","-","Subnautica Save Bug: Freezing and Crashing with RAM DrainHey everyone, I've been playing Subnautica for about 15 hours now and I'm loving it, but I've been running into a frustrating issue. When I try to save my game, it freezes and starts eating up my RAM. Eventually, my computer crashes and I have to start over from my last save. I thought it might be related to how far I had traveled in the game, but now it seems completely random. Also, it might be helpful to note that I can often tell when this bug is present before I save because of the lack of props and mobs spawning. This includes fragments, small plants, and even kelps.

Issue: I've been searching online and haven't been able to find anyone else having this problem, which makes me wonder if it's something specific to my computer. My hardware configuration includes an AMD Ryzen 5600H processor, 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD with 80GB of free space, and an Nvidia RTX3060 mobile graphics card. It's really starting to get on my nerves because it's preventing me from making any real progress in the game.

[h1]Important notes about the experimental build.[\/h1] 
This is called experimental for a reason. It can break every updates. With very painful bugs. Since it's a [b]daily build[\/b], they'll likely be fixed fast. (Not necessary really fast.)

The map doesn't update in your save file! That means you can see floating entities, stuff that isn't supposed to be there or in a wrong location. This is due to the fact that the game saves the location of every entities in the map, and if a level designer decides to change something, the game will spawn them at their old location when you open your ""old"" save. 

You can fix this by reading the next section.

[h1]Problems with the map.[\/h1]
If, for whatever reason you have things missing in part of the world, the culprit could be your CellsCache folder.

Removing the entire folder will make PDAs, fish (if you killed leviathans they'll be there again), and all entities respawn in the map. You're warned.
You can be selective and remove only the batch you want to regenerate. When you're in game, press F1, camera batch. You can note the index there in the format XX,XX,XX. 

Example with 12-18-12, removing baked-batch-cells-12-18-12.bin inside baked-batch-cells-12-grp0.zip and loading the game, the batch at the origin (world location (0,-1,0)) will be regenerated. 

If you have the issue with the ending remove baked-batch-cells-12-19-16.bin inside baked-batch-cells-12-grp0.zip.

The number of the zip is the same as the first number of the batch index. [b]12[\/b]-19-16 => 12, [b]13[\/b]-12-1 => 13, etc.

[h1]Version number.[\/h1]
The version number is written in the F1 menu as ""plastic changeset"".
It's also the number you see on the top right when you are in the main menu. It's a number with 5 digits currently. 

[h1]Coordinates.[\/h1]
The coordinates appear with the F1 menu in ""Camera world pos: (...)"".

[\/code]","en","-","Game won't launch after updateSo I was playing through the game, having lots of fun, and then I went to start it up today and... nothing.  For whatever reason, this latest update hosed the game so badly that it won't even start up anymore.  I've done all the normal troubleshooting stuff, all the way down to updating drivers and completely reinstalling the game, but nothing helps.  It just dies during the initialization.  As best I can tell, there's something wrong with some DLL, but I can't get anything more than that from the log.  Anyone have any ideas, short of abandoning the game and leaving a nasty review?

P.S Sorry if this was already answered I was looking though and didn't see anybody else have this problem","en","-","Character stuck when using deployablesSo this is a bug, obviously, that kind of just came up in a new playthrough I started of subanutica BZ. Any time I try to drop a water locker, throw a snowball, or place mobile vehicle bay, it gets returned to my inventory and my character gets stuck in the animation of holding whatever I was trying to use.

What i've tried:

warpforward

Dying

Other animations (opening door to pod, climbing ladder)

switching to other tools with hotkeys

opening and closing PDA

Mods I use:

BaseClocksBZ

EasyCraftBZ

QuickSlotsExtenderBZ

SeatruckSolar

SMLHelper

SubnauticaMapBZ

First symptom - after playing for a while, the level geometry\/assets stop loading - when moving outside the immediate area the geometry cuts off and there's nothing there except water.

Esc returns control to continue playing, but 'Save' is then greyed out in the menu, and 'Quit' then stops working as well ('Please wait' and never quits) - the only way to exit is to to Alt-F4.

Part 1

Hey devs!

So today I decided to start up Subnautica:Below Zero again.
I've played through the multiple times, including two (successful) runs on hardcore (Love your game and work!), so I tried giving the game a go on creative mode this time to just try to mess around with the game and the functions.

During past runs I had different experiences with the framerate\/performance of the game (bought the game in Early Access as soon as possible), but didn't really mind them and just turned down graphics quality if the framerates would drop below 30. 

Today I decided to try out various options to run the game with higher framerates (30-60 on 3440x1440 (ultra-wide monitor) and 2560x1440 resolutions while trying to achieve optimal graphical results.

With the highest texture detail option, FPS were okayish on the lower resolution, but made the FPS drop down to 24 on the higher resolution (which I don't consider playable).

My hardware is bottlenecked by my graphics card, bc I usually don't play many performance intensive games.

Hardware devices:
1) CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700x (8-core) (not overclocked)
2) GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti
3) RAM: 16 GB Patriot Viper Steel DDR4-3200 DIMM CL16

Now while running the game, I discovered that the program maxes out the GPU usage at ~97% all the time (highest texture detail), but makes poor use of the CPU and RAM capacity. The CPU-usage would only be at around 14-17% and the RAM usage would usually be around 2.400-3.200\/16.000.

Wouldn't it be possible to increase performance by allowing\/""telling"" the program to make more use of available RAM and CPU capacities?

For example by allowing the GPU to outsource some calculation tasks to the CPU or by loading more (texture) data into the RAM storage to speed up calculations in the CPU and GPU by allowing faster access to informations needed for the calculations?

I was playing Wasteland 3 recently - which also uses the Unity engine - and they had more options regarding RAM and performance (which allowed stable 54-144 FPS in ultrawide-resolution on highest g.options) which makes me hopeful that this is also possible for this game. The game allowed to set a higher limit for RAM usage for example.

Now, I don't understand much about the hardware\/software side of this, but would a performance optimization regarding this be possible?","en","-","Could graphics performance be increased?I will split up the different topics into different parts to allow better oversight.

I recently got Subnautica Below Zero and it was running fine, but it started lagging a few days ago and I have tried every remedy on the internet:

1. Updated graphics drivers
2. Terminated unnecessary background processes
3. Confirmed file integrity in both Steam and my personal files by deleting and redownloading them
4. Confirmed that my hardware was not overheating (My graphics card never exceeds 40C because of Fan Control, same with CPU)
5. Did a malware detection (none detected with Windows Threat Protection)
6. Changed in-game settings to garbage (still didn't work)
7. Ran Task Manager during the game to see if processors were having trouble, which they weren't.

At this point I would rather find a problem than for it to magically fix itself because this has been such a long road. I'm very new to computers and I've had a rough start even with my relatively good computer. This is especially frustrating because I can play Subnautica 1 and other games without any lag, but this one gives me trouble. I will appreciate any and all feedback. 

My hardware and software is as follows, if this helps at all:
Hardware:
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz watercooled
GPU: GEFORCE GTX 960 dual fan cooled, with HDMI output
RAM: 16GB divided among 4 sticks of 4GB
Software:
OS: Windows 10 Pro
GPU Driver Version: 30.0.14.7212

I apologize if some of this was formatted incorrectly or if I am missing information, I've only started to learn computer stuff about 2 months ago when I got my current one to play video games and study for college on.

Started up Below Zero for the first time today and I keep experiencing a complete breakdown of the graphics engine as soon as I turn my character to the side. The HUD stays fine, but by the looks of it anything 3D breaks down. Setting graphics to high will cause me to only see a black or white screen, and setting graphics to low does cause a 3D image, but with atrocious resolution and massively distorted colors.
The PDA displays normally, but the hand that's supposed to be holding it doesnt.
I searched around and the closest thing I found to my issue is that sometimes the world isn't loading, which can be fixed by reloading the game a few times. This clearly wont work in my case.

"Subnautica: Below Zero","Survival","UweBoll","1","Problem with starting Subnautica Below Zero","en","-","
Since the last update, I can't start Below Zero anymore.

Everytime I try to start the game, the following happens:
- game synchronizes with cloud
- window is opening with the typical epilepsy-warning
- window vanishes and game quits

What I tried to solve the problem:
- reinstalled the game
- tried starting the game with all beta versions
- turned steam overlay on and off
- turned cloud synchronizing on and off
- started the game as an administrator
- checked driver updates
- started clean boot

Nothing helped and I'm really frustrated about it, since the game ran quite well for weeks and now I'm not able to play anymore.
I'm really thankful for all ideas to find a solution!

Subnautica Below Zero, what the Dock update:

I uninstall the game on Steam and install it from scratch. I switch off cloud sync. No old savegames, I guess this is thanks to switching off cloud sync.

I start a new survival game after the What the Dock update, save and continue several times. No problem at all.

Last night, I save while standing in my small base (only 1 X base piece with 2 hatches, 1 multiprpose  & 1 scanner room), the seatruck (only base module) parked outside. Both are near the escape pod (near in the sense of only having to swim ten seconds from the pod to the base). The base had been built several game days before.

I play a new game in creative mode, for a few hours. Not sure if this is related.

When I restart the survival game today and continue from the last save, I see this:
- Half my inventory is filled with snowballs. I only picked up snow one time and got rid of the snowball immediately, days before, so all of the snowballs are new. Not all inventory slots are filled.
- All recipes are listed as known in the Wrench tab.
- The recipes I KNEW at the point of save are flagged as NEW, although they are definitely NOT new. All the other recipes are NOT flagged, although they ARE new.
- My base is gone. Gone is also the equipment stored inside and the resources stored in the base, in wall lockers (about 12 wall lockers). Other than those (about) 12 wall lockers in the multipurpose room, there were a standard work desk, a bed, three posters from Delta on the wall, and three chique plantters with nut trees. The connected Scanner Room had nothing in it. The X Compartment at the other end of the multipurpose room had 3 wall lockers and 2 hatches.
- The truck and the escape pod are still there.
- Nothing special visible about the area or plants \/ animals where the base was placed.

I did not save again and was warned about the last save being 3 minutes old when I exited, so I guess the crazy save game still exists, if anyone would be interested in looking at it.

Any idea what might have gone wrong, and how I could prevent this in the next game? Or does it remind you of a known Subnautica 1 bug?","en","-","Subnautica Below Zero savegame went crazy with the saved statusIf you have any speculations what might have gone wrong here, I would love to read them.

I play a new game in creative mode, for a few hours. Not sure if this is related.

When I restart the survival game today and continue from the last save, I see this:
- Half my inventory is filled with snowballs. I only picked up snow one time and got rid of the snowball immediately, days before, so all of the snowballs are new. Not all inventory slots are filled.
- All recipes are listed as known in the Wrench tab.
- The recipes I KNEW at the point of save are flagged as NEW, although they are definitely NOT new. All the other recipes are NOT flagged, although they ARE new.
- My base is gone. Gone is also the equipment stored inside and the resources stored in the base, in wall lockers (about 12 wall lockers). Other than those (about) 12 wall lockers in the multipurpose room, there were a standard work desk, a bed, three posters from Delta on the wall, and three chique plantters with nut trees. The connected Scanner Room had nothing in it. The X Compartment at the other end of the multipurpose room had 3 wall lockers and 2 hatches.
- The truck and the escape pod are still there.
- Nothing special visible about the area or plants \/ animals where the base was placed.

I did not save again and was warned about the last save being 3 minutes old when I exited, so I guess the crazy save game still exists, if anyone would be interested in looking at it.

Any idea what might have gone wrong, and how I could prevent this in the next game? Or does it remind you of a known Subnautica 1 bug?","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/5875531492229056350/","19/09/22 08:51","18/01/2024 10:35:31","Bug Report"

With our recent launch on the Nintendo Switch, you can choose to play Stranded Deep on PC or the console of your choice. As we expand to other platforms – and as we prepare to launch another big new feature – there has become a need to keep the discussion in one place. So, moving forward, the official home for all Stranded Deep discussion will be our forums at: https:\/\/forums.strandeddeepgame.com\/

The Steam forums will continue to operate, but we will be directing all discussion and bug reports to our official forum from now on. This transition will help us and our community managers, Clare and Oisín (Night_Snake), to better identify and help with any issues you’re experiencing.

I’d like to personally say a big thanks to our volunteer Steam moderators: Omen3608, fluxtorrent, Skarmo and Cosmo. There’s no way Ben and I could have managed in the early days with how quickly our community grew. We really appreciate the huge time and effort you’ve put into the community.

As always, a huge thanks to everyone for your support!

Stay Alive! [\/quote]

So your best bet is to post Bug Reports on their official forums from now on! Thanks!

Some users have been sending in reports of the game attempting and failing to initialize the resolution to 154x0 at start up. We haven't been able to reproduce the problem on our end yet, but it seems to be caused by the resolution settings in the registry being corrupted. The good news is, it's fixable :)

[h1][i]DISCLAIMER: The steps here are relatively straightforward, but if you don't feel comfortable modifying registry keys then we would advise against it.[\/i][\/h1]

1. Open the Registry Editor (You can find this easier by typing ""regedit"" in the Windows search bar, or pressing the Windows Key + R and then entering ""regedit"").
2. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\/Software\/BEAM Team Games\/Stranded Deep
3. Locate the two entries responsible for resolution. They will be named similar to ""Screenmanager Resolution Height"" and ""Screenmanager Resolution Width"".
4. You will need to change the width and height values to something ""safe"" like 1024 wide x 768 high. Before doing that make sure ""Decimal"" is selected, then enter your new resolution value for each entry.

That should get you going again. We're actively looking into why this is happening in the first place. It seems to happen with other games running the Unity engine as well so we'll be trying to get to the bottom of it asap.

Current issues we have encountered.

Players going invisible

Items in players inventory being visible for others and if interacted with, deletes from players inventory (By visible I mean it drops on the ground for you, but for them they can't see it)

Items and storage boxes suddenly not being able to be interacted with.

Random red stone tool appearing n being stuck on the island.

Crafting an item and having it stuck on the screen not being able to cancel the craft or interact with anything.

Trees cut down by others appearing as a low res 2D png.

Stretchy models (Mostly trees and masts)

Constant beeping (This is extremely annoying and happens if a player dies or is low on something even if they get revived or fill that need it still beeps)
Watch beeping every 10 sec despite there being nothing wrong.
Watch beeping for you when something happens for someone else.

Random deaths and health dropping suddenly for no reason.

Bats appearing as a static model instead of having animations.

Flock of static bats being stuck in the air.

Items disappearing out of thin air (Placed paddle in the hook on the raft and it went poof, so we can't use the raft anymore now)

I will edit this and add more as I play. If anyone else has any bugs they have found I'll add that too. Maybe the devs can use this to know what is broken or just understand how broken multiplayer is.","en","-","Multiplayer badly needs work [List of issues]Last time I tried multiplayer it worked aite, I took a long break and have recently come back to playing this game and holy what happened?

As the title says, I can't dismantle a barrel raft base part that I built onto my raft in a hurry thinking I could just take it apart and put it where I actually wanted it. I stripped literally everything off it, there are no sails, rudder, anchor, places to store boxes or anything that the raft bases could be connected to (other than each other) yet the game says ""this cannot be removes because it relies on a crafted item"". It says that for every single raft base part, and flipping it upside down or trying to break it from other angles does nothing and still gives me this error.

I did some research and realized I have found the one and only shipwreck island. I went to the island and that is when the glitches occurred. Before I have even step foot on the island when three glitches had happen. The first glitch was that I cannot pause the game, the only way was to tab out and force quit on the game. The second glitch was that I became a god, what I mean is that I had infinite health, oxygen, stamina, you name it. The third glitch was that sound was broken. All these glitches I either figured out on the island or on the boatride to it.

On the island, the boat that I saw wasn't even real. I saw posts online that the boat was actually accessible and had a interior, however for me it was completely different. There was no interior, since I can phase through the entire ship and saw that the ship had nothing inside. I check back to see my storage and realized that the game completely removed everything in my chests. I retried going to the island to see if it was a weird mishap that happen, but no, my 2nd and 3rd try going to the island the same glitches happened.

I know there is no fixes for this and that the devs will probably not fix this (judging by how many glitches are still in the game), but I want to see if any of you guys have this glitch, or is it just something with my save that is causing this to happen.","en","-","Shipwreck Island Completely BrokenTo put it simple, I was playing singleplayer on my save and was looking for islands to loot, that is when I spotted it, the biggest ship I have ever seen in this game beached on a island.

The last boss the giant squid I killed it and finally got the achivement so, very weird I was expecting to get the achivement after killing my first boss but anyways that's one problem. 

Next is ""Call Me Ahab"" (kill all the bosses) so after killing all the bosses to get that last achivement I didn't get this one so I was like ""Ok fair enough maybe I did something wrong?"" So I made a new world and literally speed runned all the bosses in under 3 in game days and I still didn't get the achivement and yes I did collect the trophy of each boss after I killed it.

I wanted to play online with him since they have recently added it? Well long story short he can connect to online, make a world and even invite me but, when I click play online I get a message on my screen saying 'Error cannot connect to server'. I can't even get to the screen to where it says host or join a game.
I downloaded it on PlayStation 5 I have no issues on there playing online its only my PC. I have already went through all the trouble shooting steps there are on the forms page an online to potentially fix this issue! I would just play in on the PlayStation but the graphics and story line stuff is way different!

If someone has a potential fix for me please let me know!!!!!!

So not sorted. im stuck in the raft untill further notice. additionally, the game wont allow me to launch in full screen mode anymore. I've only started the game up about 10 times since download and this happend out of the blue. I've heard trying ALT+enter while in game fixes the full screen issue, but haven't tried it yet. will update once i troubleshoot more.

Updated by m.mac86
ALT+ENTER does fix the full screen issue, but these are 2 separate issues. Now im just stuck in the raft in full screen. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but this did nothing as i dont know how to clear the game cache. I know this because all the custom settings i have set are still set after reinstalling. I dont know how to clear the cache after uninstalling as im new to steam.

Response from Cosmo and Fred:
Not being able to escape whilst 'mounted' on the raft is by design as far as I am aware, you have to disengage from the raft to be able to use escape. Of course if you are unable to disengage from the raft that is most likely a bug and probably an idea to make a post in the bugs forum :)

(m.mac86) Ill try a few other things and update this discussion with any further troubleshooting results, however there's not much you can do from the start of the game until you get to an island. im new to this game so i doubt i'll be able to evade the sharks and swim to the island. One thought i had off the hop is that it may have something to do with the tutorial goals interfering with the game functions, but i dont exactly know how the tutorial is embedded into the game. Some games allow you to skip the starting tutorial, but since the tutorial is literally the first few milestones in the game, i doubt that this is possible. Please respond if we already have a fix or any information on this. Also is somebody can direct me on clearing the game cache after uninstalling the game then i can reinstall under default game settings and see if that helps.

Like many people on Mac M1 there is a huge bug that prevents you from being able to play the game globally, it's not a ""little bug"" that you can put aside and still play.

The watch is TOTALLY INACCESSIBLE and therefore it is impossible to actually play the game and fully enjoy it.

This bug has existed for more than a year and despite ""updates"" the problem is still not fixed.

Then I did the same work, installed the lamp holder, but the problem did not occur again.
I ask developers not to abandon Stranded Deep. And think about new updates. One of them would be to solve this type of bug. Other suggestions would be: to enable the construction of a small base on the ferry (like a cabin).

Is this a bug or? because at first i didnt have any problem with my raft.
Must say i transported a barrel on it to my island (took forever now) but when i was on my island i took all crates of my raft and still could not handel my raft well and with motor is was going crazy!!!","-","https://steamcommunity.com/app/313120/discussions/10/4792394847132895374/","31/01/22 08:18","18/01/2024 10:44:51","Bug Report"

It looks like the moment u step on an island the spoiling timer get activated. 

When you have 2 or more small crabs in inventory and then drop one it hurls away.

Ai animals broken? (absolute gamebreaker)

I’ve played 100 ingame days and only encountered 2 snakes, for example if you kill the 2 big crabs on a big island but it gets late and wait until next day, there is a good chance that all the other animals are gone!
I have seen several times small boars walking or hanging in the air (first day i arrive) and then they fall into the sea!
1 of the snakes i attacked with 1 crude spear (throwing) start turning around in circles and then flew away in the shallow water and turning around in circles underwater there!
Also sometimes when I threw a crude spear at a wild boar it runs to middle part of island and than disappear with all other animals!?! and when he attacks or (runs away) he also lift off the ground a few meters just like all other animals.
(Have seen pics off other ppl finding wild boars, little boars in sea, also big crabs hanging in the air and more crazy stuff going on!)

I also noticed that the seaguls, bats, … only came to my starter island (maybe also to the nearest islands around the starter island not sure!) but not on the further islands and the small crabs not really spawning back, mostly 1 spawn back on land (was always hanging on my pile coconuts :) and 2 in sea (even on starter island), normaly there around 8 spawn back every ingame week i think.

Sharks clipping through low water sand texture but also clipping alot through the character himself in open water without damage and seen a few 360° shark dances also. 


interact with meat on firepit sometimes don't work (mostly because the fuel to low, if u at few sticks or leaves u can interact again)

Unlimited drinkable coconuts in piles (drink coconut than put it back in pile
its drinkable again).

I took a shark repellent than went mining clay and got poisioned, had no antidote with me.
The next day i took another shark repellent and went back mining clay,
when i came out of the water i wasn’t poisoned anymore!?! No idea if it was the second shark repellent i used that unpoisioned me or something else, the only thing i did after taking the second shark repellent was mining abit more clay and caught 3 lion fish when i came back i saw me health was full again and me arm looked normal and the watch confirmed i wasn’t poisioned anymore?

Flickering shadows on islands further away from the starter island, i think the neighbour islands where still fine if i remember correctly but further away this annoying flickering shadows starts and when i looked at my watch there was a small shakiness going on when this flickering shadows are there.
The only way to get rid of it is disable shadows completely!

So many storms is that normal? like atleast every 2 days sometimes everyday??
This accually makes the game much easier (which i don’t like) because u never have to water your crops also less filling of the water still and no SPF to worry about.

Sometimes the leaves are still there under the water still while it says zero fuel or leaves.

When climbing a palm tree there was a lock or limit how high u could climb in earlier versions, now u get kicked out off the tree (and break legs) when u climb to high because the lock or limit is gone!
All palm trees have 1 coconut now there used to be trees with 2?

This game also needs muuuuuuuuch better draw distances!!! rocks on the side of the islands draw in very late, wrecks and textures look terrible from still pretty close distance.
Very far graphics option is not even a small island length b4 the lods chance to the lowest!
I'm playing with a low end 4gb 1050ti gpu 4gb system mem. Q9300 core duo quad cpu on windows 7 and can still play with most setting at high or ultra and very far draw with 30 fps

Additionally, The animals are not just aggressive but hyper aggressive and move in fast forward, they always know where you are, right now i have 2 sharks circling my raft in the shallows at 3-4 times their normal speed making it impossible to even get off my raft without getting grabbed, But even if i do step on land, all the boars and crabs (Large and Small) start making their way to me until i enter the water.

Please can we get a fix? seems like a bit of an urgent bug having an entire game mode break like this.

Getting stuck on poles is unfixable, as the car will spin to the top of the utility pole, and not even a real rocket can move it afterward.

It's been a persistent issue, and hopefully, despite the challenges of car physics, it'll be resolved someday.

Greetings, On or about the 16th of Oct, 2023, view in my Trade History, several Rust Skins were fraudulently traded from my account. I did not in any way, shape or form, authorize this trade yet my Rust Items are just gone. The account is a lv 1 account and is currently trade banned and I'd like my items back. I'd also like to know how this was even possible as I've had zero interactions with this person. I've noticed my Rust Inventory Items went missing and for the past two weeks have been trying to figure out what happened. Today I stumbled on to Trade History and found several items traded away and I'm here to say it was fraud. You can check my history and I don't trade; I think maybe 1 or 2 at the most but years ago. This trade needs to be reversed and I'd like my Rust Items back. I didn't think to view trade history because I simply don't make trades. I've invested a lot of money into this game and it's been stolen away. I was not hacked nor have I given anyone access to my account. I recently added a few friends but deleted them as they just seemed shady. Anything you can do to return these items would be greatly appreciated.

Virtual Environments are pretty common these days and are becoming even more common in the future.
Just think about to share the Compute Power of your new Rig in the basement with the whole Family. This is not exotic anymore and there are plenty of Virtual Environments who support this!

I used water pumps, setup large batteries near the lake and powered them with wind turbines and solar panels. I then ran a water pipe line and a electric line parallel to each other from the lake to my house. I extended the water hose every 50m by putting down a fluid switch and pump and applied electricity to it if it required it. I extended my electric cable every 50m by using an electric branch.

I was able to do this from right side of the map into nearly the center of the map successfully. I probably used 30-40 fluid switch and pumps and electric branches along the way but I could constantly see ""water input 108"" and ""water output 108"" in every single fluid switch and pump along the way. 

But just shortly before my house it seems to be bugging. On a water barrel I see ""input water 108"". But it does not fill up. If I move the water barrel back to the last fluid switch and pump, then it fills up correctly.

The last station where it does not work the following is true:
1. The fluid switch and pump has 108 input value and 108 output value.
2. The fluid switch and pump has active electricity connected.
3. The water barrel (which is connected to the fluid switch and pump) says ""108 water input"", indicating that it is receiving water, but does not fill up.

What can be the problem here?
