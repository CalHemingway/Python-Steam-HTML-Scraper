PINNED:TROUBLESHOOTING: Read this first.,Ignis,0,"First, please look at this post for the common issues: https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=1640719623\n\n[h1]Reports.[\/h1]\nIdeally you want to submit as much information as possible. \nThis includes your platform (PC, MAC), the version number (see below), the reproduction steps (what you did to trigger the bug).\n\n[b]Be sure you don't have any mods![\/b] Third party content might cause unexpected bugs that is not the developer's responsability. \nAn update might break your mods. They'll probably be updated. Until then please make sure you report bugs that aren't caused by them.\n\nUninstalling the game doesn't remove the mods. Make sure you don't have BepInEx, Qmods, and winhttp.dll in the game's directory.\n\nThe log file (named Player.log or just Player) may be important. \nCopy \/ paste its content on https:\/\/pastebin.com and share the link in your post.\n\nIf you have a crash and want to share the crash dump please check: https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=403087864 and send it directly to the developers. \n\nIf you encounter an issue with something on the map, share your screenshot via Steam (F12 to take them), [b]be sure you have the F1 menu open![\/b] It will help to know where you are when you encounter it.\n\n[h1]Important information.[\/h1]\nYou can copy \/ paste the following paths directly in the address bar of your file explorer.\n\nSave folder on windows: [code]Epic: shell:localappdatalow\\Unknown Worlds\\Subnautica Below Zero\\SubnauticaZero\\SavedGames\\slotXXXX\\\nSteam: <pathOfYourSteamFolder>\\SteamApps\\common\\SubnauticaZero\\SNAppData\\SavedGames\\slotXXXX\\\nDiscord: %localappdata%\\DiscordGames\\Subnautica Below Zero\\content\\SNAppData\\SavedGames\\slotXXXX\\[\/code]XXXX is a number which is incremented with the number of your save file, 0000, 0001, etc.\n\nLog file location: \nWindows (you can copy \/ paste this directly in the file explorer): [code]shell:localappdatalow\\Unknown Worlds\\Subnautica Below Zero\\Player.log[\/code]\nMac: [code]~\/Library\/Logs\/Unknown Worlds\/Subnautica Below Zero\/Player.log\n[\/code]\nCrash dump location: [code]%localappdata%\\Temp\\Unknown Worlds\\Subnautica Below Zero\\Crashes\\[\/code]\n\n[h1]Important notes about the experimental build.[\/h1] \nThis is called experimental for a reason. It can break every updates. With very painful bugs. Since it's a [b]daily build[\/b], they'll likely be fixed fast. (Not necessary really fast.)\n\nThe map doesn't update in your save file! That means you can see floating entities, stuff that isn't supposed to be there or in a wrong location. This is due to the fact that the game saves the location of every entities in the map, and if a level designer decides to change something, the game will spawn them at their old location when you open your \""old\"" save. \n\nYou can fix this by reading the next section.\n\n[h1]Problems with the map.[\/h1]\nIf, for whatever reason you have things missing in part of the world, the culprit could be your CellsCache folder.\n\nRemoving the entire folder will make PDAs, fish (if you killed leviathans they'll be there again), and all entities respawn in the map. You're warned.\nYou can be selective and remove only the batch you want to regenerate. When you're in game, press F1, camera batch. You can note the index there in the format XX,XX,XX. \n\nExample with 12-18-12, removing baked-batch-cells-12-18-12.bin inside baked-batch-cells-12-grp0.zip and loading the game, the batch at the origin (world location (0,-1,0)) will be regenerated. \n\nIf you have the issue with the ending remove baked-batch-cells-12-19-16.bin inside baked-batch-cells-12-grp0.zip.\n\nThe number of the zip is the same as the first number of the batch index. [b]12[\/b]-19-16 => 12, [b]13[\/b]-12-1 => 13, etc.\n\n[h1]Version number.[\/h1]\nThe version number is written in the F1 menu as \""plastic changeset\"".\nIt's also the number you see on the top right when you are in the main menu. It's a number with 5 digits currently. \n\n[h1]Coordinates.[\/h1]\nThe coordinates appear with the F1 menu in \""Camera world pos: (...)\"".\n\n[h1]Below Zero issue tracker.[\/h1] \nThis is the internal bug tracker used by the developers.\n\nPriorities are set as follow:\n[list]\n[*]5: Unclassified.\n[*]4: Low priority.\n[*]3: Normal severity.\n[*]2: High priority.\n[*]1: Severe.\n[\/list]https:\/\/snexpansion.unknownworlds.com\/issue-tracker\n\n[h1]Enabling the console.[\/h1] \nWhen you're in the game, shift + enter. If it doesn't work it's due to a bug with Qmod. \n\nFrom there, type a command and validate with enter again.\n\nA common issue is walking on the sea floor like you walk on land. \nIf you have the bug, typing \""warpforward\"" will solve it.\n\n[b]Using commands disable achievements in your save file![\/b]",https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/3004425113424358890/

I would like to complete the game, and to do that, I kinda need my prawn and all it's upgrades (I only had the two arms and the boost upgrade thing).

Could graphics performance be increased?,Sushi_Rocks,10,"I will split up the different topics into different parts to allow better oversight.\n\nPart 1\n\nHey devs!\n\nSo today I decided to start up Subnautica:Below Zero again.\nI've played through the multiple times, including two (successful) runs on hardcore (Love your game and work!), so I tried giving the game a go on creative mode this time to just try to mess around with the game and the functions.\n\nDuring past runs I had different experiences with the framerate\/performance of the game (bought the game in Early Access as soon as possible), but didn't really mind them and just turned down graphics quality if the framerates would drop below 30. \n\nToday I decided to try out various options to run the game with higher framerates (30-60 on 3440x1440 (ultra-wide monitor) and 2560x1440 resolutions while trying to achieve optimal graphical results.\n\nWith the highest texture detail option, FPS were okayish on the lower resolution, but made the FPS drop down to 24 on the higher resolution (which I don't consider playable).\n\nMy hardware is bottlenecked by my graphics card, bc I usually don't play many performance intensive games.\n\nHardware devices:\n1) CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700x (8-core) (not overclocked)\n2) GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti\n3) RAM: 16 GB Patriot Viper Steel DDR4-3200 DIMM CL16\n\nNow while running the game, I discovered that the program maxes out the GPU usage at ~97% all the time (highest texture detail), but makes poor use of the CPU and RAM capacity. The CPU-usage would only be at around 14-17% and the RAM usage would usually be around 2.400-3.200\/16.000.\n\nWouldn't it be possible to increase performance by allowing\/\""telling\"" the program to make more use of available RAM and CPU capacities?\n\nFor example by allowing the GPU to outsource some calculation tasks to the CPU or by loading more (texture) data into the RAM storage to speed up calculations in the CPU and GPU by allowing faster access to informations needed for the calculations?\n\nI was playing Wasteland 3 recently - which also uses the Unity engine - and they had more options regarding RAM and performance (which allowed stable 54-144 FPS in ultrawide-resolution on highest g.options) which makes me hopeful that this is also possible for this game. The game allowed to set a higher limit for RAM usage for example.\n\nNow, I don't understand much about the hardware\/software side of this, but would a performance optimization regarding this be possible?",https://steamcommunity.com/app/848450/discussions/1/5501743491371389919/

Performance issues in Subnautica: Below Zero,johnathonrawlings05,2,"Hi all,\n\nI recently got Subnautica Below Zero and it was running fine, but it started lagging a few days ago and I have tried every remedy on the internet:\n\n1. Updated graphics drivers\n2. Terminated unnecessary background processes\n3. Confirmed file integrity in both Steam and my personal files by deleting and redownloading them\n4. Confirmed that my hardware was not overheating (My graphics card never exceeds 40C because of Fan Control, same with CPU)\n5. Did a malware detection (none detected with Windows Threat Protection)\n6. Changed in-game settings to garbage (still didn't work)\n7. Ran Task Manager during the game to see if processors were having trouble, which they weren't.\n\nAt this point I would rather find a problem than for it to magically fix itself because this has been such a long road. I'm very new to computers and I've had a rough start even with my relatively good computer. This is especially frustrating because I can play Subnautica 1 and other games without any lag, but this one gives me trouble. I will appreciate any and all feedback. \n\nMy hardware and software is as follows, if this helps at all:\nHardware:\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz watercooled\nGPU: GEFORCE GTX 960 dual fan cooled, with HDMI output\nRAM: 16GB divided among 4 sticks of 4GB\nSoftware:\nOS: Windows 10 Pro\nGPU Driver Version: 30.0.14.7212\n\nI apologize if some of this was formatted incorrectly or if I am missing information, I've only started to learn computer stuff about 2 months ago when I got my current one to play video games and study for college on.

Subnautica Below Zero savegame went crazy with the saved status,merusalem,0,"If you have any speculations what might have gone wrong here, I would love to read them.\n\nSubnautica Below Zero, what the Dock update:\n\nI uninstall the game on Steam and install it from scratch. I switch off cloud sync. No old savegames, I guess this is thanks to switching off cloud sync.\n\nI start a new survival game after the What the Dock update, save and continue several times. No problem at all.\n\nLast night, I save while standing in my small base (only 1 X base piece with 2 hatches, 1 multiprpose  & 1 scanner room), the seatruck (only base module) parked outside. Both are near the escape pod (near in the sense of only having to swim ten seconds from the pod to the base). The base had been built several game days before.\n\nI play a new game in creative mode, for a few hours. Not sure if this is related.\n\nWhen I restart the survival game today and continue from the last save, I see this:\n- Half my inventory is filled with snowballs. I only picked up snow one time and got rid of the snowball immediately, days before, so all of the snowballs are new. Not all inventory slots are filled.\n- All recipes are listed as known in the Wrench tab.\n- The recipes I KNEW at the point of save are flagged as NEW, although they are definitely NOT new. All the other recipes are NOT flagged, although they ARE new.\n- My base is gone. Gone is also the equipment stored inside and the resources stored in the base, in wall lockers (about 12 wall lockers). Other than those (about) 12 wall lockers in the multipurpose room, there were a standard work desk, a bed, three posters from Delta on the wall, and three chique plantters with nut trees. The connected Scanner Room had nothing in it. The X Compartment at the other end of the multipurpose room had 3 wall lockers and 2 hatches.\n- The truck and the escape pod are still there.\n- Nothing special visible about the area or plants \/ animals where the base was placed.\n\nI did not save again and was warned about the last save being 3 minutes old when I exited, so I guess the crazy save game still exists, if anyone would be interested in looking at it.\n\nAny idea what might have gone wrong, and how I could prevent this in the next game?
